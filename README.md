# Predicting Outcomes in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

For this project I;

1. Scraped the full texts of all the opinions google scholar had from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (2012-2018).
2. Vectorized all the unique citations in each opinion (over 15,000 Federal, New York, Vermont, and Connecticut citations).
3. Scored each case (from -4 to 5) based of outcome for the Appellant.

Using the presence of each unique citation, I was able to predict the outcome of various legal cases (Immigration, Criminal, Tort, Civil Rights).
