SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
The district court dismissed Petitioner-Appellant Gabriel Taylor's 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition as untimely but granted a certificate of appealability ""limited to the following question: Whether [an] unexplained 36-day delay in Petitioner's receipt of the New York Court of Appeals' decision denying his motion for leave to appeal is an `extraordinary circumstance' sufficient to equitably toll [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's (""AEDPA"")] limitations period."" Taylor v. Racette, No. 14 Civ. 312A, 2016 WL 5871282, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 2016). This pro se appeal followed, which we review for abuse of discretion. See Saunders v. Senkowski, 587 F.3d 543, 549-50 (2d Cir. 2009). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Assuming arguendo that Taylor's petition was filed on January 27, 2014,[2] it was nevertheless untimely unless he was entitled to equitable tolling for the 36 days between September 26, 2012, when the New York Court of Appeals denied him leave to appeal, and November 1, 2012, when he received the court's order. See People v. Taylor, 19 N.Y.3d 1029 (2012) (denying leave). Although we have held that failure by a state court to send notice of a ruling within a reasonable time can constitute an extraordinary circumstance tolling AEDPA's limitations period, Diaz v. Kelly, 515 F.3d 149, 155-56 (2d Cir. 2008), we have also made clear that ""a delay occasioned by the normal course of the mail"" is not such ""an `extraordinary' circumstance,"" Saunders, 587 F.3d at 550. The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the delay here, which fell between these two extremes but far closer to the latter than the former, did not entitle Taylor to equitable tolling.
To obtain the benefit of equitable tolling, moreover, Taylor had to demonstrate not only that ""he experienced extraordinary circumstances,"" but also that ""those circumstances caused him to miss the original filing deadline."" Harper v. Ercole, 648 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 2011). Here, Taylor waited approximately 15 months to file his petition in federal court after receiving the state court's order denying him leave to appeal. Even if the delay between the Court of Appeal's decision on September 26, 2012, and Taylor's receipt of that decision on November 1, 2012, did constitute extraordinary circumstances, ""causation is lacking"" because such circumstances ""arose and concluded early within the limitations period."" Id. Taylor's untimely filing more than one year later cannot be attributed to that 36-day delay.
We have considered all of Appellant's arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to amend the caption matter as above.
[2]  Taylor signed the petition on January 27, 2014. Despite indicating in his petition that he mailed it on that day, however, he certified elsewhere in his petition that he placed it in the prison mail system on February 3, 2014. The Supreme Court has held that the moment of filing in such litigation should be the moment when the pro se prisoner ""delivered the notice to prison authorities for forwarding."" Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 270 (1988). ""Indeed, in the absence of contrary evidence, district courts in this circuit have tended to assume that prisoners' papers were given to prison officials on the date of their signing."" Hardy v. Conway, 162 F. App'x 61, 62 (2d Cir. 2006) (summary order). Yet Taylor's certification that he placed his petition in the prison mailing system on February 3, 2014 could constitute such contrary evidence. If his petition were deemed to have been filed on February 3, 2014, it would be 39 days late, and untimely even if equitable tolling were appropriate, since he alleges only a delay of 36 days in receiving the notice that leave to appeal was denied.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Sherwood and Heather Boyce appeal from a January 10, 2017 order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York affirming a December 15, 2015 order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York that denied the Boyces' motion to reopen an adversary proceeding. They argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) over their adversarial action after they received a discharge in the underlying Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
1. Background
In 2006, the Boyces executed a mortgage note that was secured by a mortgage granting a lien on a property in Wheatley Heights, New York. The mortgage was recorded and ultimately endorsed to Citibank. The Boyces defaulted on loan repayments, and in May 2008 Citibank initiated a foreclosure action in state court. In exchange for forbearance, the Boyces executed two stipulations with Citibank in which they agreed to pay arrears and waive defenses to the foreclosure proceeding. The Boyces again failed to make their loan payments, and Citibank recommenced the foreclosure proceedings, ultimately obtaining a default judgment against the Boyces.
Sherwood Boyce filed for bankruptcy, and began an adversary proceeding against Citibank,[1] challenging the validity of Citibank's mortgage lien and disputing his and his wife's indebtedness to Citibank. With consent of the Boyces' attorney, the bankruptcy court entered two orders in June 2012, the first abstaining from the adversary proceeding in favor of Citibank's state court foreclosure action, and the second ordering that the adversary proceeding be administratively closed. Sherwood Boyce received his Chapter 13 discharge seven months later.
In state court, the Boyces moved to vacate the default judgment that had been entered against them. The court denied this motion, concluding that they had waived any defenses to foreclosure in exchange for forbearance.
After losing their state court appeal, see Citibank, N.A. v. Boyce, 131 A.D.3d 439 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't 2015), the Boyces returned to the federal bankruptcy court and moved to reopen their adversary proceeding and to stay the state court foreclosure action. Characterizing their motion as ""a transparent attempt . . . to overrule the orders of the state trial and appellate courts,"" J.A. at 1316, the bankruptcy court declined to reopen their adversary proceeding. On appeal, the district court determined that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion. The Boyces filed a timely notice of appeal.
2. Discussion
""A bankruptcy judge's decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen . . . shall not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion."" In re Smith, 645 F.3d 186, 189 (2d Cir. 2011). A court ""has `abuse[d] its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,' Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990), or rendered a decision that `cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions,' Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir. 2001)."" In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008).
Bankruptcy courts may hear adversary proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b), which gives bankruptcy courts original but not exclusive jurisdiction over civil suits ""arising in or related to"" bankruptcy cases. Courts have ""related to jurisdiction"" if the suit ""might have any conceivable effect"" on the bankruptcy estate. Picard v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., 762 F.3d 199, 211 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting In re Cuyahoga Equip. Corp., 980 F.2d 110, 114 (2d Cir. 1992)). The dismissal or closing ""of an underlying bankruptcy case does not automatically strip a federal court of jurisdiction over [a pending] adversary proceeding which was related to the bankruptcy case at the time of its commencement. The decision whether to retain jurisdiction [] [is] left to the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court,"" which ""must consider four factors in determining whether to continue to exercise jurisdiction: judicial economy, convenience to the parties, fairness and comity."" In re Porges, 44 F.3d 159, 162-63 (2d Cir. 1995).
Even assuming, arguendo, that ""related to jurisdiction"" could have survived dismissal of the bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in applying the Porges factors. It found that:
the remaining dispute does not impact [Sherwood Boyce's] bankruptcy estate; it would also be unfair and inconvenient to force Citibank to re-litigate the state law issues before this Court; the parties had unequivocally agreed to resolve all of their disputes before the State Court, as memorialized by the Abstention Order; and comity also weighs in favor of declining to exercise jurisdiction — [Sherwood] and [Heather Boyce] have lost before the New York state courts after years of protracted litigation and should not be allowed to utilize this Court's jurisdiction to attempt to circumvent those determinations.
J.A. at 1317-18. We consider this analysis reasonable. See Zervos, 252 F.3d at 169.
The Boyces's arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. They argue that their pretrial discovery in the adversary proceeding will have been wasted unless the proceeding is reopened, but this argument presumes that the state court litigation, which resulted in a final judgment, was somehow deficient. They also complain that no court has ever adjudicated their challenges to Citibank's mortgage on the merits. This fact, while true, does not establish that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in declining to reopen an adversary proceeding addressing matters that had already been extensively litigated to final judgment in state court.
* * *
We have considered the Boyces' remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Petitioner-appellant Chauncey Mahan, pro se, appeals from the district court's order awarding possession of property seized by the Los Angeles Police Department (""LAPD"") to respondent-appellee Roc-A-Fella Records, LLC, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 503(b) of the Copyright Act. Mahan, a sound engineer, sued respondents Roc Nation, LLC; Roc-A-Fella Records, LLC; and Shawn Carter (""Jay Z"") under the Copyright Act, seeking a declaratory judgment that he was the co-owner of recordings created in 1999 and 2000, which were stored on disks, CDs, cartridges, computers, hard drives, and an audio player, and kept in Mahan's personal storage unit until they were seized by the LAPD in 2014. In 2016, we affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action, awarded attorney's fees and costs to the respondents for Mahan's appeal, and remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of calculating those fees and costs. See Mahan v. Roc Nation, LLC, 634 F. App'x 329 (2d Cir. 2016). On remand, the respondents sought possession of the property seized by the LAPD, and the district court imposed the § 503(b) order from which Mahan now appeals. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
The relevant statute provides:
As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order the destruction or other reasonable disposition of all copies or phonorecords found to have been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights, and of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced.
17 U.S.C. § 503(b). We review orders issued under 17 U.S.C. § 503(b) for abuse of discretion. Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301, 313 (2d Cir. 1992). Upon review, we conclude that the district court's order awarding possession of the seized property to Roc-A-Fella Records under § 503(b) was not an abuse of discretion. We take Mahan's arguments one-by-one.
First, the district court's order did not violate the mandate rule. The mandate rule precludes re-litigation of matters expressly or impliedly resolved by an appellate court's mandate. Brown v. City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 2012). This Court did not resolve the issue of possession of the seized property, either expressly or impliedly, in Mahan's prior appeal. See Mahan v. Roc Nation, LLC, 634 F. App'x 329 (2d Cir. 2016).
Second, the respondents did not have to prove that copyright infringement had already occurred. The statute permits the court to order the reasonable disposition of property ""by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced."" 17 U.S.C. § 503(b) (emphasis added).
Third, § 503(b) is an equitable remedy that does not require compliance with state statutes of limitations for separate and unrelated torts, or pleading at the outset of an action, or seizure of property. See Rogers, 960 F.2d at 313 (order to turn over property in a copyright infringement case was ""an equitable remedy issued under the broad powers vested in a trial judge under 17 U.S.C. § 503(b)""). The district court had authority to order the reasonable disposition of the disputed property pursuant to § 503(b) irrespective of whether Mahan could raise Fourth Amendment claims against the LAPD.
Fourth, the district court did not violate due process. Mahan received notice and had an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the § 503(b) order, and he three times opposed or objected to the order. The district court was not required to provide a jury trial. See Germain v. Conn. Nat. Bank, 988 F.2d 1323, 1328 (2d Cir. 1993).
Fifth, Mahan did not show that the respondents allegedly fraudulent statements amounted to fraud on the court. See Gleason v. Jandrucko, 860 F.2d 556, 559 (2d Cir. 1988) (litigant must show that fraud ""seriously affect[ed] the integrity of the normal process of adjudication"").
Finally, we easily conclude that Judge Schofield's impartiality would not be reasonably questioned by an objective observer. See SEC v. Razmilovic, 738 F.3d 14, 29 (2d Cir. 2013).
We have reviewed Mahan's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit or improperly raised for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Pedro Goris pleaded guilty to illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Forrest, J.). The district court sentenced Goris to a 36-month term of imprisonment, to run consecutively to an undischarged 60-month term of imprisonment previously imposed on Goris in state court for an unrelated drug offense. Goris challenges as substantively unreasonable the district court's decision to impose his federal sentence consecutively to his state sentence. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Goris argues that the consecutive imposition of his 36-month federal sentence is substantively unreasonable because he will serve a total of 96 months in prison—a sentence above the Guidelines Sentencing Range of 51 to 63 months he claims would have applied if his state-law drug offense had been prosecuted as a federal offense alongside his illegal-entry offense. See U.S.S.G. § 3D1.1 (laying out the procedure for determining the total offense level in a case involving a multiple-count conviction).
We review for substantive reasonableness under ""a particularly deferential form of [the] abuse-of-discretion [standard]."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 188 n.5 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). We will set aside the district court's decision ""only in [an] exceptional case[] where [that] decision `cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.'"" Id. at 189 (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir. 2007)). This is not an exceptional case.
A district court is free to require that a new sentence run consecutively to an undischarged term of imprisonment in order to ""achieve a reasonable punishment for the [new] offense."" U.S.S.G § 5G1.3(d); see United States v. Maria, 186 F.3d 65, 72 (2d Cir. 1999). The court's decision to do so in this case was permissible because it was guided by a reasonable application of the relevant factors. See U.S.S.G § 5G1.3(d), comment. 4; 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); see also United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 253 (2d Cir. 2012).
In particular, the court observed that both of the offenses at issue were serious; that Goris had been convicted of several other serious offenses and had served at least one substantial prison sentence; that this was not Goris's first conviction for entering the United States illegally; that Goris had ""been deported a number of times"" and ""reentered illegally a number of times""; and that there was ""[no]thing in the record [to] indicate[] that [Goris] ha[d] changed"" or ""that [he] w[ould] not try to reenter again."" App'x. at 98, 102. The court then reasonably concluded that, ""without a separate significant sentence that recognizes the separateness of [the] crime [of illegal entry from the crime of illegal possession of a controlled substance], [Goris would be] likely to reenter again."" Id. at 103-04. This was no abuse of discretion.
Goris also asserts that United States v. Witte, 515 U.S. 389 (1995), stands for the proposition that a defendant's punishment should not depend on whether he is prosecuted in a single proceeding or in two separate proceedings, and hence, the consecutive sentence that he received is unreasonable. But Witte concerns § 5G1.3(b) of the Guidelines, which protects defendants ""against having the length of [their] sentence multiplied by duplicative consideration of the same criminal conduct."" Witte, 515 U.S. at 405. In this case, the conduct was separate: Goris illegally reentered the country and separately committed a controlled substance offense. Therefore, Goris's reliance on Witte is not persuasive.
We have considered Goris's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the November 23, 2016 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Mostafa Ahsan (""Ahsan"") appeals from a judgment of the District Court following a trial on damages in which the jury found for the Defendant-Appellee Staples, the Office Superstore East, Inc. (""Staples""). Ahsan seeks reversal and remand to the District Court for a new trial. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Ahsan claims that, while shopping in Staples, boxes fell off a shelf and hit him, causing various head, neck, and shoulder injuries. Staples concedes that its negligence caused the one or two boxes to fall from a shelf on the date of Ahsan's accident, but it disputes the nature and extent of his injuries and whether its negligence proximately caused them. Following a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict for Staples. Ahsan moved for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, and also asserted that an exemplar of the plastic file folders contained within the type of boxes that fell on him was improperly received in evidence. The District Court denied the motion. Ahsan raises several issues on appeal: 1) whether the District Court erred in denying Ahsan's motion; 2) whether the District Court erred in admitting certain items into evidence; and 3) whether the District Court erred in rejecting Ahsan's proposed jury instructions.
Ahsan moved for a new trial on the contention that the jury's finding of no proximate cause was based on insufficient evidence and was otherwise against the weight of the evidence. We review a district court's denial of a Rule 59(a) motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. See Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d 415, 422 (2d Cir. 2000). We recognize an exception to this rule: where a district court denies a motion for a new trial made on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the ruling is not reviewable on appeal. See Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Asbestos Claims Mgmnt. Corp., 73 F.3d 1178, 1199 (2d Cir. 1995). Even if we accept Ahsan's assertion that his motion for a new trial and his argument on appeal challenges not only the weight of the evidence but also its sufficiency, substantially for the reasons cited by the District Court, we conclude that the District Court's denial of Ahsan's motion was not clearly erroneous.
Ahsan contends that the District Court improperly admitted exemplar file folders and photographs into evidence. We review the District Court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Abascal v. Fleckenstein, 820 F.3d 561, 564 (2d Cir. 2016). District courts have broad discretion over the admission of evidence, and ""unless it is likely that in some material respect the factfinder's judgment was swayed by the error,"" no substantial right is affected and a new trial is not warranted. Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 150 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Substantially for the reasons cited by the District Court, we conclude that the District Court's admission of the evidence in question was not clearly erroneous, nor did it affect any substantial right.
Finally, Ahsan argues that the District Court erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury that Staples' liability had already been established. We review a district court's jury instruction de novo. LNC Invs., Inc. v. First Fid. Bank, 173 F.3d 454, 460 (1999). ""A jury charge is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard, or if it does not adequately inform the jury of the law."" Hathaway v. Coughlin, 99 F.3d 550, 552 (2d Cir. 1996). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the District Court did not err in issuing its jury instruction.
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by plaintiff on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the November 23, 2016 judgment of the District Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ASUMMARY ORDER@). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment entered on December 1, 2016, is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff Pepi Schafler, proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court's order dismissing her negligence, fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and conspiracy claims against defendant Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (""Merrill Lynch"") as barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel, and the applicable statutes of limitations. She also appeals from the district court's filing injunction—which requires Schafler to include a copy of the district court's dismissal order with any new action she files in the Southern District of New York—and the district court's denial of her motion to join additional parties. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a claim as time-barred and its application of res judicata and collateral estoppel. See Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg v. Galizia, 300 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2002) (collateral estoppel); Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 126 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir. 1997) (res judicata); Ormiston v. Nelson, 117 F.3d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1997) (statute of limitations). Upon such review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Schafler's complaint. We affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned November 30, 2016 order.
We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a filing injunction on Schafler. A district court may, in its discretion, impose a filing injunction if confronted with ""extraordinary circumstances, such as a demonstrated history of frivolous and vexatious litigation . . . or a failure to comply with sanctions imposed for such conduct."" Milltex Indus. v. Jacquard Lace Co., 55 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); see generally In re Martin-Trigona, 9 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 1993). A district court ""may not impose a filing injunction on a litigant sua sponte without providing the litigant with notice and an opportunity to be heard."" Moates v. Barkely, 147 F.3d 207, 208 (2d Cir. 1998). We consider the following factors when reviewing a lower court's filing injunction:
(1) the litigant's history of litigation and in particular whether it entailed vexatious, harassing or duplicative lawsuits; (2) the litigant's motive in pursuing the litigation, e.g., does the litigant have an objective good faith expectation of prevailing?; (3) whether the litigant is represented by counsel; (4) whether the litigant has caused needless expense to other parties or has posed an unnecessary burden on the courts and their personnel; and (5) whether other sanctions would be adequate to protect the courts and other parties.
Safir v. U.S. Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 19, 24 (2d Cir. 1986). The question the court ultimately must answer is ""whether a litigant who has a history of vexatious litigation is likely to continue to abuse the judicial process and harass other parties."" Id.
The district court here meticulously recounted Schafler's prior actions challenging the 2001 bankruptcy order approving the sale of her stock certificates, as well as the sanctions imposed on her by other courts for continually seeking to relitigate that decision. Schafler was on notice of a possible injunction because Merrill Lynch requested it in its motion to dismiss, but Schafler chose not to address the request in the four opposition briefs she filed. At this point, Schafler cannot have any objective, good-faith expectation of prevailing on her claims. And as the district court correctly observed, despite repeated warnings and sanctions in several jurisdictions, Schafler has continued to file actions raising the same issues. Accordingly, the district court's limited filing injunction, which requires only that Schafler include a copy of the district court's dismissal order with any new action she files in the Southern District of New York, was not an abuse of discretion.
The district court also did not abuse its discretion by denying Schafler's motion to join an additional party. See MasterCard Int'l Inc. v. Visa Int'l Serv. Ass'n, 471 F.3d 377, 385 (2d Cir. 2006). Schafler argues that joinder was necessary because additional parties participated in the alleged conspiracy. The reasoning underlying the district court's dismissal of her complaint, however, would also bar any claims against additional parties.
Insofar as Schafler urges vacatur because Judge Román exhibited bias against her, the record belies this claim, see Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994), and shows that Judge Román resolved the case in an appropriate and impartial manner.
We have considered all of Schafler's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant James Patrick Colliton, a former lawyer appearing pro se, appeals from the district court's December 27, 2016 order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint. Colliton sued individuals and organizations involved in administering his probation and sex offender treatment. The first amended complaint alleged (inter alia) that the defendants had violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by requiring him to comply with mandatory polygraph examinations. The district court dismissed that claim sua sponte on November 5, 2015. The third amended complaint alleges that the defendants had violated Colliton's First Amendment rights to practice his religion and needlessly imposed sex offender treatment. In opposition to the defendants' motions to dismiss the third amended complaint, Colliton submitted an affidavit containing new factual assertions, and requested leave to amend his complaint a fourth time. By order on December 27, 2016, the court declined to consider Colliton's affidavit and granted the motions to dismiss. The court denied leave to amend unless Colliton filed a formal motion by January 2017 addressing specific issues. Colliton did not file the motion and, instead, appeals to this Court. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
With respect to the November 2015 Order, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court's sua sponte dismissal of the Fifth Amendment polygraph claim because the notice of appeal designated only the December 2016 Order (granting the defendants' motions to dismiss) as being challenged on appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (a notice of appeal must ""designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed""); Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P., 756 F.3d 73, 93 (2d Cir. 2014). Because Colliton is a former lawyer, he is not entitled to any special solicitude as a pro se litigant. See, e.g., Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 101-02 (2d Cir. 2010).
In any event, the claim fails on the merits. ""[W]e have held that a condition requiring polygraph tests for defendants convicted of sex crimes does not violate the right against self-incrimination as long as the supervisee retains the right to challenge in a court of law the use of incriminating statements as violations of his Fifth Amendment rights."" United States v. Ramos, 658 F.3d 120, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2012). Nothing in the record indicates that Colliton would not have had such a right if defendants had charged him with parole violation and urged an adverse inference from his refusal to submit to a polygraph test. Accordingly, we identify no error in the district court's dismissal of the Fifth Amendment polygraph claim.
With respect to the December 2016 Order, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Colliton's remaining claims. We review the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo, ""accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff."" Trs. of Upstate N.Y. Eng'rs Pension Fund v. Ivy Asset Mgmt., 843 F.3d 561, 566 (2d Cir. 2016). We review the district court's denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. Anderson News, L.L.C. v. American Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185 (2d Cir. 2012).
The district court did not err when it declined to consider Colliton's affidavit submitted in opposition to the defendants' motions to dismiss since, generally, courts cannot consider new factual assertions in an affidavit submitted in opposition to a motion to dismiss. See Faulkner v. Beer, 463 F.3d 130, 134 n.1 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, it did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend, given that Colliton had already amended his complaint three times, made no formal motion to amend despite being given an opportunity to do so, did not submit a proposed amended complaint, and provided no justification for waiting to seek amendment. See Yerdon v. Henry, 91 F.3d 370, 378 (2d Cir. 1996). A district court may deny leave to amend ""for good reason, including futility, bad faith, undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party."" TechnoMarine SA v. Giftports, Inc., 758 F.3d 493, 505 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 200 (2d Cir. 2007)). The district court based its decision on these factors, and required Colliton to address them if he made a formal motion seeking leave to file a fourth amended complaint.
We have considered all of Colliton's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.

CORRECTED SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the orders of the district court are AFFIRMED.
Appellant David Roemer, proceeding pro se, sued the New York Attorney Grievance Committee (""State Committee"") as well as Columbia University's general counsel, Jane Booth, and president, Lee Bollinger, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Roemer is a retired high school science teacher who has repeatedly offered to give a lecture on the cosmological argument for God's existence at Columbia University (""Columbia""), offers that Columbia repeatedly declined. In October 2016, Booth wrote to Roemer advising him that continued efforts to contact members of the Columbia community could be considered harassment. Roemer responded by filing an ethics complaint against Booth with the State Committee, which was dismissed. Before the district court, Roemer sought injunctive relief against the defendants for depriving him of the right to free speech and violating the Establishment Clause. The district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint as frivolous. Roemer subsequently moved for the district court judge to recuse himself and for default judgment against Bollinger. The district court denied the recusal motion, and this appeal followed. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
As an initial matter, Appellees Booth and Bollinger argue that we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying dismissal of Roemer's complaint because his notice of appeal designated only the district court's order denying recusal. We ""construe notices of appeal liberally, taking the parties' intentions into account."" Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 256 (2d Cir. 1995). Consistent with this principle, a brief may serve as a notice of appeal required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 when it is filed within the time specified by Rule 4, Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248-49 (1992), and parties may file ""an amended notice of appeal within the time limits set forth by Rule 4,"" Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp., 602 F.3d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 2010). Here, Roemer's brief—which was filed a mere five days after his notice of appeal and within the time specified by Rule 4—operates as an amended notice of appeal. Therefore, the issues identified therein are properly before this Court. This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of Rule 3's requirement, which is ""to ensure that the filing provides sufficient notice to other parties and the courts."" Smith, 502 U.S. at 248.
On appeal, however, we agree with the district court that Roemer's complaint was frivolous. Roemer provides no legal argument but only cursorily states that he is ""certain"" that he is ""right"" and that the district court wrongly concluded that he had no cause of action, Appellant Br. at 12, and has therefore arguably abandoned his claims. See Tolbert v. Queens Coll., 242 F.3d 58, 75 (2d Cir. 2001). In any event, his claims are meritless. Neither Columbia employee is a state actor. See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49-50 (1999) (explaining that an action brought under § 1983 must be based on an alleged deprivation by an individual acting under color of state law). And Roemer lacks standing to challenge the State Committee's decision not to discipline Booth. See In re Attorney Disciplinary Appeal, 650 F.3d 202, 203-05 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam).
Roemer also challenges the district court's denial of his recusal motion, a decision we review for abuse of discretion. United States v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 34, 48 (2d Cir. 1998). A judge should recuse when ""a reasonable person, knowing all the facts, would question the judge's impartiality."" United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 169 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). Roemer hypothesizes that the district court's passing reference to his religious and philosophical beliefs demonstrates bias by the court. However, the district court merely stated that, in finding Roemer's legal theories meritless, it ""expresse[d] no views on Mr. Roemer's religious and philosophical beliefs."" App. at 18. This statement would not lead an ""objective, disinterested observer"" to question whether the district court judge was biased against Roemer, Yousef, 327 F.3d at 169, and the dismissal order itself is insufficient to demonstrate bias, see Chen v. Chen Qualified Settlement Fund, 552 F.3d 218, 227 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (observing that ""adverse rulings, without more, will rarely suffice to provide a reasonable basis for questioning a judge's impartiality""). Accordingly, we see no abuse of discretion.
Roemer also argues that he was entitled to default judgment against Bollinger. We disagree. Although the district court did not explicitly rule on Roemer's motion for default judgment, any error was harmless: the district court had already sua sponte dismissed Roemer's complaint, therefore there was no basis for entry of default judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 61 (""At every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party's substantial rights.""). And Roemer's conjecture that Bollinger may have ""decided to let the court issue whatever injunction it deemed just"" finds no support in the record. Appellant Br. at 10.
We have considered Roemer's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's orders.

A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Hamerton Jeanty, pro se, sued his employer, the New York City Department of Finance (""the Department""), for discrimination and retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-34. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Gardephe, J.) granted summary judgment for the Department on Jeanty's discrimination claim, and a jury found for the Department on Jeanty's retaliation claim. On appeal, Jeanty argues that the court erred by granting the Department summary judgment on the discrimination claim and by granting the Department an extension of time to file summary judgment papers. He also challenges certain evidentiary rulings made by the court during the trial on the retaliation claim. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Department on Jeanty's discrimination claim. See Sotomayor v. City of N.Y., 713 F.3d 163, 164 (2d Cir. 2013). An independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the district court properly granted the Department summary judgment for substantially the reasons stated in the district court's thorough September 22, 2015, order. The court also acted well within its discretion in granting the Department a two-week extension of time to file summary judgment papers. See Tancredi v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 378 F.3d 220, 226 (2d Cir. 2004).
2. We review preserved challenges to the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, see Silverstein v. Chase, 260 F.3d 142, 145 (2d Cir. 2001), and unpreserved challenges to those rulings for plain error, see Pescatore v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 97 F.3d 1, 18 (2d Cir. 1996).
Jeanty primarily presses an unpreserved challenge to the court's admission of certain time records. Jeanty fails to establish an error on the part of the court, much less an ""error . . . so serious and flagrant that it [undermines] the very integrity of the trial."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Jeanty also challenges the court's ruling that he could not introduce the deposition of a trial witness. This challenge fails. A deposition may be used to impeach a trial witness, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(2), and it is admissible when the witness's trial testimony is inconsistent with the deposition testimony, see Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). But Jeanty fails to demonstrate that the witness's trial testimony was inconsistent with the deposition testimony.
We have considered Jeanty's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.
Lawford Gordon appeals from a judgment of the District Court (Griesa, J.) convicting him of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (""ACCA""), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), and sentencing him principally to fifteen years of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Because Gordon did not raise his objections in the District Court, we review the District Court's judgment for plain error. See United States v. Doe, 741 F.3d 359, 364 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Danielson, 199 F.3d 666, 671 (2d Cir. 1999). We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
1. Applicability of ACCA
Gordon first argues that the District Court erred in concluding that ACCA fixed a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence for his conviction for unlawful firearm possession. He asserts that the prior New York State convictions charged in his indictment do not qualify as ""serious drug offenses,"" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), because they were subject to a maximum term of only nine years when he was convicted, not the ten years required by ACCA, id. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). As Gordon concedes in his reply brief, however, his prior convictions—all class B felonies—were each punishable by a maximum term greater than ten years when he was convicted if he was considered a recidivist. Appellant Reply Br. 2-3. Because Gordon had already been convicted of a class C drug felony in an earlier prosecution, the maximum term of incarceration for his State convictions was twelve years pursuant to an applicable recidivism enhancement. See N.Y. Penal Law §§ 70.06, .70(1)(b), .70(3)(b)(i).
Gordon objects that the maximum term of imprisonment for his State convictions was nine years unless the State court actually found that he was a recidivist. Although he claims that no such finding is in the record, the judgments of conviction for Gordon's three 2005 offenses make clear that the State court sentenced Gordon as a second felony offender.[1] Accordingly, these convictions qualified as ""serious drug offenses"" under ACCA, and the District Court properly determined that Gordon was subject to a fifteen-year minimum sentence. See United States v. Rodriquez, 553 U.S. 377, 382-83 (2008).
2. Procedural Reasonableness
Gordon also challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. First, he asserts that the District Court did not calculate the applicable sentence range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. On plain error review, Gordon has failed to show that this purported error affected his substantial rights. Because Gordon was subject to, and received, ACCA's mandatory minimum sentence, there is no ""reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome"" of the sentencing proceeding. United States v. Marcus, 560 U.S. 258, 262 (2010).
Second, Gordon asserts that the District Court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors specified in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). We disagree. ""[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors."" United States v. Fernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338 (2007).
Finally, Gordon asserts that the District Court did not adequately explain its decision to impose the maximum period of supervised release permitted by law. Here, the record shows that the District Court considered Gordon's criminal history and hoped that Gordon would avoid another prison sentence after serving his fifteen-year term. Under these circumstances, see United States v. Cassesse, 685 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir. 2012), we are satisfied that the District Court ""considered the parties' arguments"" and had ""a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority,"" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 193 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).
We have considered Gordon's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.
[1]  We take judicial notice of these judgments of conviction pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Defendant-appellant Nadeem Mehmood Quraishi appeals a judgment of conviction entered August 18, 2016, following a jury trial, convicting him of abusive sexual contact in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 49 U.S.C. § 46506(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2244(b), and assault in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 49 U.S.C. § 46506(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5). On August 12, 2016, the district court sentenced Quraishi principally to 24 months' imprisonment. On appeal, Quraishi challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.
The record establishes that Quraishi sexually abused a victim, Jane Doe, when they — as strangers who were not traveling together — were passengers seated next to each other aboard an international flight arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, on October 26, 2015. Doe had taken medication and fallen asleep. A few hours later, when she woke up, she discovered that hand lotion had been spread on her arms, chest, and legs, including under her dress. The bottle of hand lotion that she had placed in the seat pocket in front of her before she went to sleep was missing. At that point, she went to the bathroom and noted that certain parts of her body were sore, her underwear had been shifted, and there was lotion on her body underneath her underwear.
Two flight attendants questioned Quraishi, who admitted to spreading the lotion over Doe's body. He explained that he believed that Doe ""needed it"" and ""enjoyed it because she did not resist."" PSR ¶ 6. When the plane landed Quraishi was arrested. During post-arrest statements, he admitted to inappropriately touching Doe while she was asleep.
On August 12, 2016, the district court sentenced Quraishi. As Quraishi violated 18 U.S.C. § 2244(b), the district court consulted the Sentencing Guidelines (""Guidelines"") Manual § 2A3.4 to determine the base offense level. The district court concluded, pursuant to § 2A3.4(a)(2), that the appropriate level was 16 as the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, which addresses engaging in a sexual act with another person who is ""incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct"" or ""physically incapable of declining participation."" 18 U.S.C. § 2242(2). There were no adjustments, and thus the total offense level was determined to be Level 16.[1] Level 16 carries 21 to 27 months' imprisonment, or as restricted by the statutory maximum in this case, 21 to 24 months' imprisonment.[2] The district court heard from defense counsel, Quraishi's friend, Quraishi's wife, and read a written statement from the victim. The district court then sentenced Quraishi to 24 months' imprisonment, the top of the guidelines range, as capped by the statutory maximum. Quraishi timely appealed, challenging the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.
A sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable only if it ""cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir. 2007)). Accordingly, we will set aside sentencing decisions for substantive reasonableness only in ""exceptional cases,"" id. at 189, that is when the sentence is ""so shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law that allowing [it] to stand would damage the administration of justice,"" United States v. Aldeen, 792 F.3d 247, 255 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 289 (2d Cir. 2012)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
The district court imposed a sentence of 24 months' imprisonment, primarily citing the seriousness of the crime and Quraishi's lack of sincere remorse. This sentence was not substantively unreasonable. Indeed, given the egregious nature of Quraishi's conduct, the district court's sentence of 24 months' imprisonment gives us no pause whatsoever.
Quraishi, in claiming his sentence was substantively unreasonable, argues that the district court allocated insufficient weight to certain mitigating considerations, such as his lack of criminal history, his family support, and his proffered psychological struggles, factors he claims makes his conduct an aberration. But the district court properly weighed these considerations and committed no error in its evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). As the district court observed in imposing the 24-month, statutory maximum sentence, ""there's a question about whether it is sufficient, but it is certainly not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in"" § 3553(a). App. 36. We agree with that assessment.
Accordingly, the district court's sentence was not substantively unreasonable.
* * *
We have considered all of Quraishi's remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  Though Quraishi contested the district court's determination at sentencing, he now concedes that the district court's calculation of a base offense level of 16 was without fault.
[2]  There is no Guidelines range for Count 2 as it is a Class B misdemeanor.

A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Barbara J. Riley, proceeding pro se, appeals from a March 23, 2017 judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismissing her quiet title, tortious inference with contract, and fraud claims against the defendants. Riley sought to quiet title to real property in Queens, New York, bringing fraud and other claims against various individuals and entities. Riley also alleged that the defendant mortgage lenders had improperly allowed Defendant-Appellee Patricia Rivers to secure loans on the property, which Riley asserted Rivers did not rightfully possess. The district court dismissed Riley's Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. In addition to Riley's appeal, Rivers moves to submit into the record her retainer agreement with her attorneys. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We begin with Rivers's motion to supplement the record on appeal. We will consider evidence not before the district court in ""extraordinary circumstances."" Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Edelstein, 526 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir. 1975); see Fed. R. App. P. 10(a)(1) (defining the record on appeal as, in relevant part, ""the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court""); Loria v. Gorman, 306 F.3d 1271, 1280 n.2 (2d Cir. 2002) (""Ordinarily, material not included in the record on appeal will not be considered.""). Since the retainer agreement Rivers wishes to add to the record was not before the district court and consideration of the exhibit would make no difference in our resolution of this appeal, the ""extraordinary circumstances"" needed to expand the record are not present. Accordingly, Rivers's motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED.
Moving on to the merits of Riley's appeal, ""[w]e review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Riley's claims. We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate judge's thorough and well-reasoned September 19, 2016 Report and Recommendation, which was adopted in its entirety by the district court. Additionally, to the extent that Riley alleges that she should have been instructed on how to replead her claims, we discern no error in the proceedings below. Riley twice amended her complaint, and nothing in the record suggests that a third amendment would cure the Second Amended Complaint's deficiencies. See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000).
We have considered all of Riley's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
ORDER OF GRIEVANCE PANEL
By order filed in May 2017, Robert M. Goldstein was directed to show cause why disciplinary or other corrective measures should not be imposed on him pursuant to Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 46(b) and (c) and Second Circuit Local Rule 46.2, based on his conduct in three criminal appeals before this Court, United States v. Cowie, 17-542, United States v. Worthy (Wise), 16-1815, and United States v. Leeper, 12-386.[1] The May 2017 order set deadlines for Goldstein's response to the order, and for him to either cure his defaults or withdraw as counsel in the two appeals that are still pending, Cowie and Worthy (Wise). Goldstein did not comply. In July 2017, this panel suspended Goldstein from practice before this Court based on his failure to respond to the May 2017 order and to take the required actions in those two appeals. The July 2017 order also stated that `[a]ny request to modify, stay, or terminate this interim suspension must comply with the requirements stated in the May 2017 order, and also address the default in this disciplinary proceeding.""
Goldstein now moves for the suspension order to be lifted. Goldstein, through an affirmation by his lawyer in support of the motion, attributes his defaults in this Court to health-related issues, although he does not specifically link those issues to the time periods during which the various defaults occurred in the three appeals and the present disciplinary proceeding. Additionally, Goldstein discusses various actions he will take that will permit him to better focus on those health-related issues and avoid future defaults; among other things, Goldstein states that he will resign from both this Court's bar and the Criminal Justice Act (""CJA"") Panel for the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.
Goldstein does not explicitly discuss Cowie and Worthy (Wise), or his failure to either cure the defaults in those appeals or withdraw from his representation of the appellants. In Cowie, after Goldstein failed to cure the defects in his April 2017 motion to be relieved (which was discussed in our May 2017 order), new counsel completed the substitution process in August 2017. See Cowie, 17-542, docs. 18 (defective motion), 19 (notice of defects), 25 (order striking defective motion), 27, 28, 30 (notices of appearance by new counsel). In requesting substitution, new counsel stated that he had been unable to contact Goldstein for purposes of effectuating the substitution. Id., doc. 32. The docket in Worthy (Wise) does not reflect any filings from Goldstein since the inception of the appeal in June 2016 and he is still shown as appellant's counsel of record; this Court will sua sponte arrange for new counsel to substitute for Goldstein.
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, we construe Goldstein's present motion as also requesting leave to resign from this Court's bar. See In re Saghir, 595 F.3d 472, 473 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that ""an attorney who is the subject of a disciplinary proceeding in this Court may not resign from the Court's bar without first obtaining leave of the Court"").
Upon due consideration of the above matters, it is hereby ORDERED that Goldstein's motion is GRANTED, the interim suspension imposed in our July 2017 order is TERMINATED, and Goldstein's resignation from this Court's bar is accepted.
We have previously declined to accept an attorney's resignation during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings where, inter alia, doing so may mislead others into believing that the attorney's separation from this Court's bar was entirely voluntary. See In re Jaffe, 585 F.3d 118, 125 (2d Cir. 2009); accord In re Salomon, 402 F. App'x 546, 549 (2d Cir. 2010) (denying leave to resign after weighing several factors, including potential for resignation to mislead the public). In other cases, we have granted leave to resign during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings after weighing various relevant factors, including the fact that a publicly issued order would help to avoid any misunderstanding of the circumstances. See In re Warburgh, 644 F.3d 173, 182 (2d Cir. 2011); In re Yan Wang, 388 F. App'x 24 (2d Cir. 2010). In the present case, Goldstein's discussion of his health-related issues makes clear that his request for leave to retire from this Court's bar is not made solely for the purpose of evading a disciplinary sanction, the defaults noted in the May and July 2017 orders were not as egregious as those involved in Jaffe, Saghir, and Salomon, and the fact that this decision will be made public makes it unlikely that the public will be misled as to the circumstances of his resignation. Accordingly, we grant Goldstein leave to resign from this Court's bar. We also terminate this proceeding and the interim suspension imposed by our July 2017 order.[2]
The Clerk of Court is directed to serve a copy of this order on Goldstein, the attorney grievance committee for the New York State Appellate Division, Fourth Department, the administrator of the CJA Panel for the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, and all other courts and jurisdictions to which this Court distributes disciplinary decisions in the ordinary course.[3]
[1]  There are several attorneys named Robert Goldstein admitted to practice in New York State. The present matter concerns Robert Michael Goldstein, who was admitted in New York State in 1972, has registration number 1760396, and has his office in Buffalo, New York (Erie County).
[2]  This Court's Local Rule 4.1 provides that an attorney representing a defendant in a district court criminal case must continue that representation on appeal even if the attorney is not admitted to this Court's bar. If Goldstein is continued as counsel in any case in this Court pursuant to Local Rule 4.1 prior to readmission to this Court's bar, he must promptly notify this Court of the need for substitution.
[3]  Counsel to this panel is authorized to provide, upon request, all documents from the record of this proceeding to other attorney disciplinary authorities. While we request that those documents remain confidential to the extent circumstances allow, we of course leave to the discretion of those disciplinary authorities the decision of whether specific documents, or portions of documents, should be made available to any person or the public.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the May 10, 2017 judgment of the District Court is VACATED and REMANDED with instructions to the District Court to enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice.
Plaintiff-Appellant Roy Den Hollander (""Hollander""), an attorney proceeding pro se, appeals from the District Court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss his complaint. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Hollander sued seven television and print news organizations and 17 journalists associated with them. He alleged that these news organizations are ""enterprises"" within the meaning of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968 (""RICO""). He alleges that these organizations and journalists violated RICO § 1962(c) by reporting false information related to the 2016 United States presidential election—and each piece of false information was a predicate act of wire fraud supporting a claim of racketeering. Defendants moved to dismiss under Fed R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1) and (12)(b)(6), arguing that 1) Den Hollander's claim violated the First Amendment; 2) Den Hollander lacked standing to assert his claim; and 3) Den Hollander failed to adequately allege a viable civil RICO claim. The District Court granted their motion, stating that ""each of these arguments is meritorious.""
We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint for lack of standing or failure to state a claim. See Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 805 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 2015). When evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court ""must accept as true all of the factual allegations set out in [a] plaintiff's complaint, draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and construe the complaint liberally."" Roth v. Jennings, 489 F.3d 499, 510 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted).
We conclude that the District Court properly granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, as Hollander did not suffer any particularized injury. Because we affirm the District Court's decision to grant the motion to dismiss on this ground, we need not reach the other elements of defendants' motion to dismiss.
However, dismissal for subject matter jurisdiction must be without prejudice, and here the District Court granted Hollander's motion to dismiss with prejudice. See Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assoc., 182 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir. 1999).
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by plaintiff on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND with instructions to the District Court to enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be, and it hereby is, AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Billy Barnes (""Barnes"") appeals the District Court's judgment granting the motions of Defendants-Appellees New York State Division of Human Rights (""Division of Human Rights"" or ""Division"") and Beth Israel Medical Center (""Beth Israel"") to dismiss his Amended Complaint (""complaint""). The complaint alleged that the Division of Human Rights and Beth Israel had violated Barnes's rights under the New York State Human Rights Law and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The District Court dismissed Barnes's complaint against the Division of Human Rights for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. It dismissed the complaint against Beth Israel for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.
The only issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly dismissed Barnes's complaint against Beth Israel on the ground of collateral estoppel. Although Barnes names both the Division of Human Rights and Beth Israel as appellees, he makes no objection to the grounds on which the District Court dismissed his complaint against the Division. He is therefore deemed to have waived any such objection that he could have made. See Norton v. Sam's Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998).
A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. v. Mayer Brown LLP, 603 F.3d 144, 150 (2d Cir. 2010). We must assume every fact alleged in the plaintiff's claim to be true and must draw every reasonable inference from those alleged facts in favor of the plaintiff. Id.
We think that the District Court correctly dismissed Barnes's complaint against Beth Israel for substantially the same reasons as those that the District Court gave in its Memorandum Opinion and Order of September 29, 2016. See Barnes v. N.Y. State Div. of Human Rights, No. 14 CV 2388-LTS, 2016 WL 5477737, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2016).
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Barnes on appeal and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the October 19, 2016 judgment of the District Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the April 11, 2016 judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.
Defendant-Appellant Shimi Zheng (""defendant"" or ""Zheng""), proceeding pro se, appeals from a judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Oswaldo Quito (""plaintiff"" or ""Quito"") on Quito's claims against Zheng and others for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., and New York Labor Law.
At the start of trial, the defendants moved to dismiss the entire complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because defendants were not an enterprise with annual sales exceeding $500,000, as is required for relief under the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. § 203(s)(1)(A)(ii). The Magistrate Judge denied the motion, holding that the $500,000 requirement was an element of the plaintiffs' FLSA claim, and not a jurisdictional requirement.
Following a bench trial, the Magistrate Judge found for plaintiff on his state law claims, but dismissed plaintiff's FLSA claims on the grounds articulated by defendants in their motion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge subsequently dismissed plaintiff's federal claims and entered an amended judgment in plaintiff's favor with respect to only his state law claims. This appeal followed. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
On appeal, defendant argues that Quito failed to prove the ""enterprise"" element of his FLSA claim, that this element is jurisdictional, and that the magistrate judge therefore should have dismissed the complaint in its entirety. He next challenges the Magistrate Judge's decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's state law claims after dismissing the federal claims.
The Supreme Court has clarified when a statutory requirement is jurisdictional and when it is instead an element of a plaintiff's claim. See Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 511 (2006) (observing that ""[s]ubject matter jurisdiction in federal-question cases is sometimes erroneously conflated with a plaintiff's need and ability to prove the defendant bound by the federal law asserted as the predicate for relief—a merits-related determination""). The Court in Arbaugh provided clear guidance for distinguishing between the two concepts: ""[W]hen Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character."" Id. at 516.
As in Arbaugh, the requirement at issue here is found within the ""definitions"" section of the statute, compare 29 U.S.C. § 203(s)(1)(A), with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b), rather than the jurisdictional section of the statute. Compare 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(3). No other text in the FLSA gives any indication that Congress intended for § 203(s)(1)(A) to be jurisdictional. We thus conclude that § 203(s)(1)(A) is ""nonjurisdictional in character,"" and the court below thus did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. See Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 516.
The Magistrate Judge also did not ""abuse [his] discretion"" by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over Quito's state law claims. See, e.g., Valencia ex rel. Franco v. Lee, 316 F.3d 299 (2d Cir. 2003) (articulating the relevant standard of review). Here, Quito's FLSA claims were dismissed after trial, and ""it would have been wasteful to subject [the] case to another full trial before a different tribunal."" See Purgess v. Sharrock, 33 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir. 1994); accord Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, 388 F.3d 39, 56 (2d Cir. 2004). Furthermore, Zheng never requested that plaintiff's state law claims be dismissed after plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of proof on his FLSA claims. We thus conclude that neither judicial economy, convenience, fairness, nor comity counseled dismissal of Quito's state law claims. See Nowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182, 1191 (2d Cir. 1996).
CONCLUSION
We have considered Zheng's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant James P. Cornelio, a former attorney proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court's judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint against the State of Connecticut, the Commander of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, an officer assigned to the Department's Sex Offender Registry Unit, and two unidentified individuals. Cornelio claimed that Connecticut General Statute 54-257(c), which requires sex offenders to timely return address verification forms, was unconstitutionally vague because the State sometimes allowed individuals to cure violations by later returning ""violation letters"" not contemplated by the statute. He also claimed that the actions brought against him for late return of his June and September 2014 address verifications were malicious prosecutions.
The district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that the statute clearly and unambiguously sets forth sex offenders' obligations and the actions to be taken by state officials in case of a violation; the defendants complied with the statute's clear requirements when Cornelio violated the statute in June and September 2014; and Cornelio did not adequately allege that the defendants acted without probable cause or with malice. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ""accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff."" Trs. of Upstate N.Y. Eng'rs Pension Fund v. Ivy Asset Mgmt., 843 F.3d 561, 566 (2d Cir. 2016). The complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Although Cornelio is a pro se plaintiff, he is not entitled to special solicitude because he is a former attorney. See Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 101-02 (2d Cir. 2010).
We conclude that the district court properly dismissed Cornelio's claims. The Connecticut statute is not vague, either as applied or on its face. See Thibodeau v. Portuondo, 486 F.3d 61, 66-67 (2d Cir. 2007). Cornelio recognizes that the statute itself is ""a model of clarity,"" and he agrees that he understands its requirements. James P. Cornelio v. Connecticut, Case No. 3:16-cv-01421 (CSH), 2017 WL 2271667, *4 (D. Conn. May 24, 2017). A facial vagueness challenge therefore fails because the statute is clear and would be valid as applied to Cornelio. See Dickerson v. Napolitano, 604 F.3d 732, 741-45 (2d Cir. 2010).
""A plaintiff making an as-applied challenge must show that the statute in question provided insufficient notice that his or her behavior at issue was prohibited."" Id. at 745-46. Cornelio contends that the statute is constructed in a manner that encourages arbitrary enforcement, making it difficult to anticipate which behavior will be censured. The district court performed a thorough analysis of § 54-257(c) and rejected this claim. We agree with the district court's reasoning that the statute's language provides ""sufficient notice of or the opportunity to understand exactly what conduct is prohibited or proscribed"" and ""minimize[s] the risk of its arbitrary enforcement."" Cornelio, 2017 WL 2271667, at *8.
Lastly, Cornelio's § 1983 malicious prosecution claim fails because he does not plausibly allege that the appellants acted without probable cause. See Betts v. Shearman, 751 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2014) (""[P]robable cause is a complete defense to a constitutional claim of malicious prosecution.""). ""Probable cause to arrest a person exists if the law enforcement official, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, has sufficient knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information to justify a person of reasonable caution in believing that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested."" United States v. Valentine, 539 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The arrest warrant prepared by the police officers details conduct—the failure to return the address verification letters—that fits squarely within the prohibition of the statute. See Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1995). The warrant was issued by a neutral magistrate, and there are no allegations that the descriptions of Cornelio's conduct in the warrant were false or misleading. These undisputed facts sufficiently establish probable cause for the offense of failing to comply with sex offender registry requirements. See State v. T.R.D., 286 Conn. 191, 220 (2008).
We have considered Cornelio's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT=S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ASUMMARY ORDER@). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant Santos Morales, pro se, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint against two state prosecutors, Steven Weiss and Mitchell Rubin. Morales asserted that after his arrest for felony possession of a firearm, defendants refused to contact witnesses on his behalf and asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE"") to place a detainer on him after he filed a bond motion. Morales was placed in immigration detention by ICE for approximately three months, then returned to state custody for approximately nineteen months, and finally discharged back to ICE after the state dropped the charges against him in April 2011. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, finding that Weiss and Rubin were entitled to absolute immunity for their decision not to interview witnesses, and Weiss was entitled to qualified immunity for contacting ICE. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact. See Sotomayor v. City of New York, 713 F.3d 163, 164 (2d Cir. 2013). ""Absolute immunity bars a civil suit against a prosecutor for advocatory conduct that is intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,"" Giraldo v. Kessler, 694 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted), and applies to ""virtually all acts, regardless of motivation, associated with [the prosecutor's] function as an advocate,"" Dory v. Ryan, 25 F.3d 81, 83 (2d Cir. 1994). Defendants ""are entitled to qualified immunity if they can establish either that (1) a constitutional right was not violated or (2) the right was not clearly established."" Royal Crown Day Care LLC v. Dep't of Health and Mental Hygiene of City of New York, 746 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal citation, alteration, and quotation marks omitted).
The district court properly granted summary judgment, and we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its July 19, 2016 decision: Weiss and Rubin were entitled to absolute immunity for their decision not to contact witnesses, see Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 273 (1993); and Weiss was entitled to qualified immunity for contacting ICE because that act did not violate any clearly established constitutional or statutory right, see Royal Crown Day Care, 746 F.3d at 543.
We have considered all of Morales's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the March 22, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Michael Marom, proceeding pro se, appeals from the District Court's March 22, 2017 grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellees Town of Hempstead, Town Supervisor Kate Murray, and Code Enforcement Officers Jon Lipinsky and Martin Smith (jointly, ""Defendants""). On appeal, Marom argues that the District Court erred in finding that Defendants did not violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures when Officer Smith entered Marom's house during a realtor-hosted open house, conducted a building inspection, and issued an ""appearance ticket"" for possession of a sauna without a plumbing permit. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, ""resolv[ing] all ambiguities and draw[ing] all inferences against the moving party."" Garcia v. Hartford Police Dep't, 706 F.3d 120, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2013). ""Summary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, `there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'"" Doninger v. Niehoff, 642 F.3d 334, 344 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). Pro se submissions are reviewed with ""special solicitude,"" and ""must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest."" Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).
Officer Smith conducted the inspection during an open house to which Marom ""invit[ed] the public at large to visit the premise."" Appellant Br. at 16. While Marom suggests that visitors were not granted unlimited access to the house, id. at 20, Marom does not argue that visitors were prohibited from viewing the sauna. Nor were we able to identify any such limitation in the record.
""What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection."" Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967); see also United States v. Titemore, 437 F.3d 251, 256 (2d Cir. 2006) (""Thus a man's home is, for most purposes, a place where he expects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he exposes to the plain view of outsiders are not protected because no intention to keep them to himself has been exhibited."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Marom exposed his house and sauna to the public when he held the open house, the Defendants did not violate Marom's Fourth Amendment rights by conducting an inspection and viewing the sauna during the event. We therefore affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its March 22, 2017 Opinion and Order.
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Marom on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the March 22, 2017 judgment of the District Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be, and it hereby is, AFFIRMED.
Appellant Michael Picarella (""Picarella""), proceeding pro se, appeals from a judgment in favor of his former employer, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (""HSBC""), following a jury trial. Picarella sued HSBC for retaliation under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and state law. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We understand Picarella's appellate brief to be challenging the sufficiency and weight of the evidence. A court of appeals generally will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120-21 (1976); see also In re Nortel Networks Corp. Secs. Litig., 539 F.3d 129, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). In particular, ""[a] contention that there was insufficient evidence to warrant submission to the jury or that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal."" Sci. Holding Co. v. Plessey Inc., 510 F.2d 15, 28 (2d Cir. 1974). Picarella, who was represented by counsel in the District Court, did not move for judgment as a matter of law, either before or after submission of the case to the jury. Nor did he move for a new trial. He has therefore forfeited any challenge to the sufficiency or weight of the evidence. See id. After review of the record, we discern no ""manifest injustice"" in the jury's verdict that would justify excusal of that forfeiture. See Sojak v. Hudson Waterways Corp., 590 F.2d 53, 54-55 (2d Cir. 1978).
Picarella primarily challenges allegedly improper comments made by HSBC's counsel during opening statements, cross-examination of Picarella, and summation. We review his claims for abuse of discretion where Picarella objected in the District Court to the purported errors and for plain error where he did not. See Marcic v. Reinauer Transp. Cos., 397 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir. 2005). ""In either case a party seeking a new trial on the basis of opposing counsel's improper statements to the jury faces a heavy burden, as rarely will an attorney's conduct so infect a trial with undue prejudice or passion as to require reversal."" Id. (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).
Of the allegedly improper comments, only Picarella's challenge to counsel's opening statement is even arguably preserved. In any event, none warrants a new trial. There was nothing improper about counsel commenting on Picarella's salary. In context, these statements were intended only to show that HSBC's continuing to pay Picarella a salary was inconsistent with any common-sense notion of retaliation. Nor were HSBC counsel's arguments on summation—to the effect that this case was about greed, opportunism, and exceptional laziness and that Picarella was making a ""mockery"" of the law—""so inflammatory or so unsupported by the record as to affect the integrity of the trial and entitle [Picarella] to a new trial,"" Marcic, 397 F.3d at 127. HSBC's theory of the case was that Picarella showed poor performance beginning well before he complained of the sexual harassment of a coworker and that he complained primarily to protect himself from being fired. ""A district court is entitled to give attorneys wide latitude in formulating their arguments."" Reilly v. Natwest Mkts. Grp. Inc., 181 F.3d 253, 271 (2d Cir. 1999). Furthermore, the District Court instructed the jury three times—before opening statements, before summations, and during its charge—that statements and arguments made by counsel were not evidence. Cf. Tesser v. Bd. of Educ., 370 F.3d 314, 322 (2d Cir. 2004). On this record, we see neither abuse of discretion nor plain error.
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed Picarella's remaining arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the District Court's judgment of January 4, 2017.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the April 4, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Eustathios Karavitis (""Karavitis"") appeals from the District Court's decision granting Defendant Makita U.S.A., Inc.'s (""Makita"") motion to exclude expert testimony and motion for summary judgment. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Karavitis purchased a portable Makita circular saw and used it dozens of times over at least a 15-year period. In 2013, while using the saw to cut a piece of pine wood, he injured his thumb. Karavitis claimed that the saw ""kicked back"" and ""came out of the wood"" during use, causing the blade to lacerate his left thumb, resulting in tendon and nerve damage. Relying on the opinion of Lewis Barbe, a safety engineer, Karavitis brought suit claiming that the saw was defectively designed and lacked adequate warnings.[1] At issue is (1) whether the District Court properly exercised its discretion in excluding Barbe's testimony, and (2) whether the District Court correctly held that, with the testimony of his lone expert excluded, Karavitis failed to proffer evidence of a defect sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact for trial.
I
The decision whether to exclude expert testimony requires assessing, among other factors, the qualifications of the proposed expert; whether the proposed testimony is based on reliable data and methods; and whether the proposed testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact. Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 396-97 (2d Cir. 2005). The party proffering the proposed expert evidence bears the burden of establishing its admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Williams, 506 F.3d 151, 160 (2d Cir. 2007). ""We review a district court's determination to admit or exclude expert testimony under Daubert for abuse of discretion."" Amorgianos v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 303 F.3d 256, 264 (2d Cir. 2002). ""The decision to admit expert testimony is left to the broad discretion of the trial judge and will be overturned only when manifestly erroneous."" McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., 61 F.3d 1038, 1042 (2d Cir. 1995).
The District Court concluded that Barbe lacked adequate qualifications and that his opinions, both regarding the design of the saw and Makita's alleged failure to warn, were unreliable. Upon a review of the record, we conclude that the District Court's exclusion of Barbe's testimony for lack of adequate qualifications was not manifest error. Barbe has a bachelor's degree in fire protection and safety engineering, and has offered no explanation of how that degree qualifies him with respect to the issue in the case at hand. Barbe's record does indicate expertise in general safety engineering, as well as some experience with circular saws. But, again, Barbe failed to explain the relevance of those credentials.
The adequacy of an expert's qualifications ""can only be determined by comparing the area in which the witness has superior knowledge, skill, experience, or education"" with the actual ""subject matter of the witness's testimony."" United States v. Diallo, 40 F.3d 32, 34 (2d Cir. 1994). On that score, the District Court was within its broad discretion to determine that Karavitis failed to establish that Barbe's experience qualified him to provide expert testimony regarding this circular saw. Indeed, in several other cases—such as a tort claim related to a table saw—courts have rejected the notion that Barbe's general background in safety engineering qualifies him to offer expert testimony on the design of a particular product. See, e.g. Hilaire v. DeWalt Indus. Tool Co., 54 F.Supp. 3d 223 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).
We similarly conclude that the District Court's holding that Barbe's opinions were not reliable was not manifest error. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the District Court was within its broad discretion to find that Barbe did not reliably substantiate his central claim that the omission of a riving knife rendered the circular saw at issue unreasonably dangerous—Barbe provided neither evidence from studies on riving knives or through design testing with a riving knife. We additionally conclude that the District Court did not commit manifest error in excluding Barbe's opinions on Makita's alleged failure to warn. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court's decision not to admit Barbe's testimony was not clearly erroneous.
II
We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp., 766 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir. 2014). In doing so, we ""construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and . . . resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant."" Id. (internal citation omitted). ""A dispute about a `genuine issue' exists . . . where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-movant's favor."" Id. (internal citation omitted). ""We uphold a grant of summary judgment `if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom it was entered, demonstrates that there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that the judgment is warranted as a matter of law.'"" Id. (internal citation omitted).
The District Court found no genuine issues of fact that would preclude summary judgment. To prove a strict products-liability claim under Connecticut law, the plaintiff must show, among other factors, that ""the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user."" Bifolck v. Philip Morris, Inc., 152 A.3d 1183, 1202 (Conn. 2016). Determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous and, hence, defective requires the application of either 1) the risk-utility test or 2) the consumer expectation standard. Id. at 1192-93, 1202-03. The risk-utility test is ""our primary test,"" and the consumer expectation test is ""a secondary test,"" ""reserved for those cases in which the product failed to meet consumers' legitimate, commonly accepted, minimum safety expectations."" Id. at 1193, 1203.
We conclude that the District Court correctly applied the risk-utility test for the circular saw. We note that Connecticut's risk-utility test differs from the risk-utility test discussed in Restatement (Third) of Torts, Products Liability (which Connecticut expressly rejected). Id. at 1196-1201. And that the risk-utility test in Connecticut does not, by its terms, necessarily require expert testimony, or even cost data comparing the allegedly defective product with an alternative product. See id. at 1197, 1202-1204. The Connecticut Supreme Court describes the risk-utility test as a common-sense test, looking to the benefits and risks of the allegedly defective products in light of what are or might be available alternatives. See id. at 1203. But, even with risk-utility so defined, upon review of the record, we find that Karavitis has not proffered admissible evidence creating a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Makita's saw was unreasonably dangerous under Connecticut's risk-utility test.
We similarly conclude that the District Court properly granted summary judgment on Karavitis's failure to warn claim. He offers no evidence suggesting that different warnings would have altered his behavior. The warnings he proposes were in fact included in the manual Makita made available with the saw which Karavitis testified that he had read. Without evidence of cause, summary judgment was proper. See Haesche v. Kissner, 640 A.2d 89, 93 (Conn. 1994) (granting summary judgment because there was no evidence a warning would have altered the plaintiff's behavior).
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all the arguments raised by Karavitis on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the April 4, 2017 judgment of the District Court.
[1]  Karavitis originally brought suit in Connecticut Superior Court. Makita successfully filed for removal to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT=S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ASUMMARY ORDER@). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
This challenge to the denial of an injunction ordering the Village of Wappingers Falls (""the Village"") to reinstate one of the plaintiff companies (""Action"") to the Village's rotational tow list returns to us following a remand that instructed the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Aspen, J.) to ""reconsider Action's request"" in light of our disagreement with the court's conclusion that such an injunction would constitute impermissible retroactive relief. Pistolesi v. Calabrese, 666 F. App'x 55, 59 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Dwyer v. Regan, 777 F.2d 825, 836 (2d Cir. 1985) (holding that reinstatement constitutes prospective relief)). Our order of remand ""express[ed] no opinion on the merits of Action's request."" Id. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
""[I]f an [entity] claims [that a] federal law immunizes [it] from [a] state regulation, [a federal] court may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulat[ion] [] preempted."" Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 (2015) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-56 (1908)). However, a court presented with a request for injunctive relief must determine whether—in view of equitable considerations and any applicable statutory limitations—the particular injunction sought ""is an appropriate remedy to be granted"" in that case. Dwyer, 777 F.2d at 836.
Prior to the remand, Action successfully petitioned the district court for a declaratory judgment that Requirement 4 of the Village's tow-list guidelines was preempted by 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1), and for an injunction barring the Village from enforcing that requirement. See Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384 (""[I]n a proper case, relief may be given in a court of equity. . . to prevent an injurious act by a [local official]."" (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). On remand, the district court denied the additional injunctive relief that Action had requested—reinstatement to the tow list—on the ground that it would not be ""an appropriate remedy."" Dwyer, 777 F.2d at 836. The court reasoned that Action's request amounted to an attempt to enforce § 14501(c)(1), which does not give rise to a private right of action. See Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385 (a party ""cannot, by invoking [a federal court's] equitable powers, circumvent Congress's exclusion of private enforcement""); see also W. Air Lines, Inc. v. Port Auth. of New York & New Jersey, 817 F.2d 222, 225 (2d Cir. 1987) (""A claim under the Supremacy Clause that a federal law preempts a state regulation is distinct from a claim for enforcement of that federal law."").
We review the district court's denial of the requested injunction for abuse of discretion. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). We are ""free to affirm"" the court's conclusion that court-ordered reinstatement would be inappropriate in this case ""on any ground that finds support in the record."" Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP, 854 F.3d 150, 160 n.6 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Headley v. Tilghman, 53 F.3d 472, 476 (2d Cir. 1995)). We affirm on the ground that Action can point to no ""irreparable injury""— traceable to (or likely to result from) the preempted local rule—that warrants reinstatement. eBay, 547 U.S. at 391.
Requirement 4, which barred from admission to the tow list any ""applicant[]"" operating on the ""same premises or real property"" as ""another Tow Rotation Service,"" was enacted after Action had already been removed from the tow list. App'x at 97. It was therefore not the cause of Action's removal. Nor was Requirement 4 ever the basis for denying Action admission to the tow list; Action did not apply for admission during the time in which Requirement 4 was in effect, and it has not applied for admission in the nearly three years since Requirement 4 was declared preempted.
To the extent that Action's request for reinstatement is predicated on the belief that it will be unlawfully denied admission on the basis of Requirement 4, see Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384 (""[F]ederal courts may in some circumstances grant injunctive relief against [local officials] who are . . . planning to violate[] federal law.""), it has already received the relief to which it is entitled. The Village is enjoined from enforcing Requirement 4. And in the event that the Village violates that injunction, the district court has ample power to enforce it.[1]
Action therefore fails to identify a past or future injury that warrants the additional relief it requests. Accordingly, that relief was properly denied.
We have considered Action's arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.
[1]  We note that Action has only pursued this action against the local officials in their individual, rather than official, capacities. Thus, in the event that the Village cites Requirement 4 to prevent Action from re-joining the list and Action seeks to enforce the injunction, the district court should consider whether further injunctive relief would be proper against the local officials in this case.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.
Nathaniel J. Buckley appeals from a judgment of the District Court (Telesca, J.) granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Buckley's sole argument on appeal is that genuine disputes of material fact exist as to his common law malicious prosecution claim against Adam Rees, Jacqueline M. Jackson, and their employer AlliedBarton Security Services, LLC (""AlliedBarton""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
Under New York law, ""[t]he elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are: (1) the commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding by the defendant against the plaintiff, (2) the termination of the proceeding in favor of the accused, (3) the absence of probable cause for the criminal proceeding and (4) actual malice."" De Lourdes Torres v. Jones, 26 N.Y.3d 742, 760 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). The failure to establish a single element defeats the malicious prosecution claim. Brown v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 746 N.Y.S.2d 141, 145 (1st Dep't 2002).
We do not need to decide whether Rees and Jackson commenced the prosecution by making false statements to law enforcement authorities. See De Lourdes Torres, 26 N.Y.3d at 760. Summary judgment was appropriate because even without reference to the alleged false statements, the authorities had probable cause to initiate and continue the proceeding against Buckley. See Brown, 746 N.Y.S.2d at 147 (holding that false statements made by a civilian defendant did not vitiate probable cause because ""probable cause existed for plaintiff's arrest without any reference to the alleged statements""). Statements by Jackson and video recordings of the incident adequately establish probable cause for the trespass charge. Indeed, Buckley concedes that he was standing on property that Rees and Jackson (correctly) believed to be private property when he and his fellow protesters were directed to leave the area. Accordingly, we assign no error to the District Court's grant of summary judgment on Buckley's common law malicious prosecution claim against Rees, Jackson, and AlliedBarton.
We have considered Buckley's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the May 19, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant KIPP Academy Charter School (""plaintiff"" or ""KIPP"") appeals from the District Court's order granting the motion of Defendant-Appellee United Federation of Teachers, AFT NYSUT, AFL-CIO (""defendant"" or ""UFT"") to dismiss KIPP's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on the ground that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
BACKGROUND
KIPP, a charter school in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City, was created in 2000 pursuant to New York's Charter Schools Act. Principally at issue in the dispute between KIPP and the UFT is whether the employment policies and practices applicable to other New York City public school teachers under the UFT's collective bargaining agreement (""CBA"") with the New York City Department of Education applies to KIPP teachers, or whether the school operates independently.
KIPP has claimed its independence from the UFT for quite some time. In 2009, its teachers filed a petition with the Public Employment Relations Board (""PERB"") in which they sought to formally establish that UFT did not represent KIPP teachers, and that the terms of the UFT CBA did not apply to KIPP teachers. PERB rejected this petition, and KIPP has since remained under the purview of the UFT.[1] KIPP's attempts at dissociation from the UFT stem from its stated fear that inclusion within the UFT would compromise the school's distinct approach to education, and would alter the pay and working conditions of KIPP teachers.
In June 2016, the UFT alleged that KIPP had committed 18 different violations of 10 provisions of the CBA. After KIPP continued to assert that it was not subject to the CBA's prescribed methods of dispute resolution, the UFT served a demand for arbitration under New York State law and American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") rules. The CBA mandates that any dispute not resolved by the UFT's prescribed grievance process must be resolved by arbitration. KIPP then filed a petition in New York State Supreme Court seeking a stay of the arbitration on the ground that it was not subject to the terms of the UFT's CBA. It also sought a temporary restraining order delaying the arbitration until its petition could be heard on the merits.
The New York State Supreme Court dismissed KIPP's petition and declined to sign KIPP's temporary restraining order. KIPP then filed suit in United States District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the school is not subject to the CBA, and seeking the same stay of arbitration.[2] The District Court dismissed the complaint pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prohibits a litigant from seeking to reverse an adverse state court judgment by filing suit in federal court. The District Court held that KIPP's federal complaint ran afoul of Rooker-Feldman because it essentially sought review of the New York State Supreme Court's decision to decline to stay the arbitration. In addition to Rooker-Feldman, the UFT also claimed that KIPP's complaint was barred under the doctrines of issue and claim preclusion. The District Court did not reach those arguments, finding Rooker-Feldman a sufficient basis for dismissal.
DISCUSSION
When reviewing the district court's dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ""we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo, accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Liranzo v. United States, 690 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir. 2012). It is well-settled that we ""may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record, including grounds not relied on by the district court."" Bruh v. Bessemer Venture Partners III L.P., 464 F.3d 202, 205 (2d Cir. 2006).
The Rooker-Feldman doctrine directs federal courts to abstain from considering claims when four requirements are met: (1) the plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment; (3) the plaintiff invites district court review of that judgment; and (4) the state court judgment was entered before the plaintiff's federal suit commenced. McKithen v. Brown, 626 F.3d 143, 154 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280 (2005) (explaining the Rooker-Feldman doctrine).
I
KIPP argues that the District Court erred in dismissing its complaint pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because not all four of the doctrine's prerequisites were met. KIPP contends that its federal complaint did not allege that the New York state court caused its injury, and thus the District Court mistakenly found that the second prong of Rooker-Feldman was satisfied. We agree with KIPP that the District Court misapplied the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.
KIPP relies on Hoblock v. Albany County Board of Elections, our leading case defining the contours of Rooker-Feldman, and notes its holding that the doctrine ""does not deprive a District Court of subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court."" 422 F.3d 77, 86 (2d Cir. 2005). If the injury complained of is ""simply ratified, acquiesced in, or left unpunished"" by the state court, the injury claimed in federal court is not directly caused by the state court judgment, and Rooker-Feldman does not bar the federal suit. Hoblock at 88. KIPP thus correctly contends that ""a plaintiff who seeks in federal court a result opposed to the one he achieved in state court does not, for that reason alone, run afoul of Rooker-Feldman."" Id. at 87.
KIPP did not complain of injuries caused by the state court judgment, but merely reasserted claims already adjudicated in the state proceedings. The injury complained of by KIPP in the complaint—the UFT's attempt to force KIPP into arbitration—pre-dated the state court's dismissal of KIPP's petition and its denial of KIPP's request for a TRO. Moreover, under Hoblock, the state court's decision to deny KIPP's requested stay of arbitration did not constitute a new injury, but was rather a mere ratification of the UFT's injurious action to compel arbitration. Put another way, the injury of which KIPP complains was not ""produced by [the] state-court judgment,"" but was instead produced by the UFT; had no petition or TRO ever been filed in state court, KIPP would still have to contend with the same injury. See id. at 88. As such, Rooker-Feldman's second prong was not satisfied. Dismissal of KIPP's complaint was nevertheless appropriate because, though not barred by Rooker-Feldman, the complaint was issue and claim-precluded by the state court decision.
II
Because the Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. 1738, requires federal courts to accord state judgments the same preclusive effect those judgments would have in the courts of the rendering state, we apply New York preclusion law. Under New York law, res judicata, or claim preclusion, ""bars later litigation if an earlier decision was (1) a final judgment on the merits, (2) by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) in a case involving the same parties or their privies, and (4) involving the same cause of action."" EDP Med. Comput. Sys., Inc. v. United States, 480 F.3d 621, 624 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).
KIPP's federal complaint is barred by res judicata. The state court decision was a final judgment on the merits. The New York State Supreme Court was a court of competent jurisdiction for the relief KIPP sought. The same two parties, KIPP and the UFT, are named in both the state and federal actions. And, as already noted, the same causes of action are set forth in both the state court petition and federal complaint. In fact, some of the language used in the two documents is identical. Though KIPP asserts that it brings a unique claim—a request for declaratory judgment— in federal court, this claim is unique in name only. KIPP is still asking the District Court to revisit the state court's denial of the stay of the UFT's demand for arbitration. ""[W]hen the factual predicate upon which claims are based are substantially identical, the claims are deemed to be duplicative for purposes of res judicata."" Berlitz Sch. of Languages of Am., Inc. v. Everest House, 619 F.2d 211, 215 (2d Cir. 1980) (emphasis added). The state court's issuance of a decision on the merits is binding upon subsequent litigation between the parties, and required dismissal of KIPP's federal suit.
CONCLUSION
We have considered KIPP's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.
[1]  The PERB's decision ""sustained automatic, non-consensual representative status to the UFT in relation to KIPP teachers under New York Law."" Appellant Br. at 13.
[2]  The essence of KIPP's district court action is that the UFT's insistence on arbitration is unlawful because the New York State law under which it purports to act is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA""). KIPP further contends that under the NLRA, KIPP cannot be deemed a party to a UFT CBA to which it never agreed, and the UFT cannot be deemed to be the lawful collective bargaining representative of KIPP teachers.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED with instructions to the district court to enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice.
Plaintiff-appellant Todd C. Bank, an attorney proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court's judgment dismissing his complaint challenging the constitutionality of 26 U.S.C. § 5000A, a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") that requires individuals to pay a tax if they do not maintain minimum essential health coverage. Bank argued that § 5000A violated both his constitutional right to forgo purchasing health coverage and the Origination Clause, which requires that all bills for raising revenue originate in the House of Representatives. The district court reasoned that there is no constitutional right to forgo purchasing health coverage and that § 5000A was not a ""bill for raising revenue"" subject to the requirements of the Origination Clause. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, cl. 1. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.
We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ""accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff."" Trs. of Upstate N.Y. Eng'rs Pension Fund v. Ivy Asset Mgmt., 843 F.3d 561, 566 (2d Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). Furthermore, we are free to affirm on any ground supported in the record. Thyroff v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 460 F.3d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 2006). Although pro se litigants are generally entitled to special solicitude, Bank is not because he is an attorney. See Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 101-02 (2d Cir. 2010).
Here, Bank lacked constitutional standing to challenge § 5000A and, thus, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. See Ins. Corp. of Ir., Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (""Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . is an Art. III as well as a statutory requirement.""). To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must establish that he suffered an injury in fact that is causally connected to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Crupar-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., 861 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 2017) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). An injury in fact must be ""concrete and particularized,"" meaning that it affects the plaintiff in a personal and individual way and is not abstract, and is ""actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical."" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).
Bank has not demonstrated that he suffered an injury in fact. He currently maintains qualified coverage and does not have to pay § 5000A's ""shared responsibility payment."" Furthermore, he concedes that he is not at imminent risk of owing the shared responsibility payment, and he has not plausibly alleged that he plans to drop his current coverage and become uninsured or obtain non-qualified coverage.
While we conclude that Bank lacks standing, dismissal for subject matter jurisdiction must be without prejudice, and here the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. See Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assocs., 182 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the case must be remanded for the district court to enter an order dismissing without prejudice.
We have considered Bank's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND with instructions to the district court to enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice.

Appellant Valerie Williams, pro se, appeals from a judgment dismissing her amended complaint. Williams sued various financial institutions and law firms for fraud stemming from a mortgage foreclosure. The district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review de novo dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), ""accepting as true the allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff."" Cayuga Nation v. Tanner, 824 F.3d 321, 327 (2d Cir. 2016) (citations omitted). Williams affirmatively waives any challenge to the district court's determination that it lacked original federal jurisdiction. She argues that the district court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over her state-law claims, asserting that she submitted substantial evidence of her equitable interest in her home. As we recently reaffirmed, ""a district court `cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction unless there is first a proper basis for original federal jurisdiction.'"" Cohen v. Postal Holdings, LLC, 873 F.3d 394, 399 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Nowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182, 1187 (2d Cir. 1996)). The district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Williams's purported federal claims, and was ""thereby precluded from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over related state-law claims."" Id.
We have considered Williams's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment entered on September 28, 2016, is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff Alyssa Peterson, proceeding pro se, appeals from the dismissal of her claims for negligent misrepresentation, fraud by non-disclosure, wrongful foreclosure, and breach of good faith and fair dealing against Wells Fargo Trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (""Wells Fargo""), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (collectively, ""defendants""), and the denial of her request for reconsideration.[1] We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
Peterson's claims stem from a mortgage foreclosure action that Wells Fargo brought against her in Hartford Superior Court in 2009. In that action, Wells Fargo moved for summary judgment as to Peterson's foreclosure liability, which Peterson did not oppose and which the court granted on January 4, 2010. The parties subsequently entered the court's foreclosure mediation program to determine whether Peterson was eligible for loss mitigation. The state court, however, terminated mediation as a result of Peterson's purported failure to provide required documentation and entered a judgment of strict foreclosure on August 13, 2012. Peterson moved to open the judgment, arguing that defendants obtained it through ""multiple false representations"" and ""via false and fraudulent means . . . designed to . . . deceive the court."" Supp. App'x 58, 60. Following a hearing, the court denied Peterson's motion to open as well as her subsequent motion for reconsideration. Peterson's appeals from those decisions were dismissed as untimely.[2]
On October 22, 2014, after the conclusion of the state proceedings, Peterson commenced this federal action. Peterson's claims are premised on the same alleged wrong argued in state court: that defendants fraudulently obtained the foreclosure judgment against her by submitting false affidavits and other documents. The district court dismissed Peterson's claims as barred by res judicata, reasoning that the prior state foreclosure action was adjudicated on the merits and involved the same parties, and that her claims in this action were or could have been raised in the state action.
On appeal, Peterson argues, inter alia, that her claims are not precluded by the state-court action and that the district court abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend. In response, defendants argue that res judicata properly applies to Peterson's claims, which are barred in any event under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.
The latter point, which defendants pursue for the first time on appeal, merits little discussion because it would, at most, deprive federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction only to the extent Peterson's prayer for relief seeks vacatur of the state court's foreclosure judgment, not to the extent she seeks compensation for defendants' fraud while leaving the state judgment in place. See Vossbrinck v. Accredited Home Lenders, Inc., 773 F.3d 423, 427-28 (2d Cir. 2014) (determining Rooker-Feldman does not prevent district court from reviewing claim for damages stemming from allegedly fraudulent state foreclosure judgment, because adjudication of claim ""does not require the federal court to sit in review of the state court judgment"").
To the extent Peterson's claims were dismissed on the basis of res judicata, we review that determination de novo. See Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 126 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir. 1997).
Res judicata requires a federal court to give a state-court judgment ""the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered."" O'Connor v. Pierson, 568 F.3d 64, 69 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under Connecticut law, a prior action bars subsequent litigation between the same parties arising from the same subject matter, provided the precluded party ""had an adequate opportunity to litigate the matter"" in the prior proceeding. Id. A party has not had an adequate opportunity to litigate a claim if ""the court in the first action would clearly not have had jurisdiction to entertain the omitted theory or ground or, having jurisdiction, would clearly have declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion."" Id. at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Peterson did not have an adequate opportunity to litigate her claims for negligent misrepresentation, fraud by non-disclosure, wrongful foreclosure, and breach of good faith and fair dealing in the state foreclosure proceedings. As the defendant in that action, Peterson could have pressed those theories of relief only as counterclaims. The alleged fraud about which Peterson now complains, however, occurred during the foreclosure proceeding itself, and only after the court already had resolved the issue of liability. See CitiMortgage, Inc. v. Rey, 92 A.3d 278, 282-85 (Conn. App. Ct. 2014) (concluding counterclaim in foreclosure action permissible only if it ""arises out of the transaction or one of the transactions which is the subject of the plaintiff's complaint"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, Peterson's claims are not barred by res judicata.
Nevertheless, collateral estoppel provides an alternative basis for affirming the district court's dismissal. See Thyroff v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 460 F.3d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 2006) (""[W]e are free to affirm a decision on any grounds supported in the record, even if it is not one on which the trial court relied.""). Under Connecticut law, collateral estoppel ""prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties upon a different claim."" Trikona Advisers Ltd. v. Chugh, 846 F.3d 22, 32 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""An issue decided against a party in a prior proceeding may not be relitigated if: (1) it was fully and fairly litigated in the first action; (2) it was actually decided; and (3) the decision was necessary to the judgment."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
In moving to open the state foreclosure action, Peterson argued the same issues she now raises in federal court: that defendants obtained the foreclosure judgment ""via false and fraudulent means which were designed to . . . deceive the court."" Supp. App'x 58, 60. There, as here, she argued that defendants had submitted false affidavits and documents stating that she had not provided the required documents for loss mediation or participated in the loss mediation program. She also argued that defendants had submitted the incorrect bankruptcy court information. The state court held an evidentiary hearing on these matters before rejecting Peterson's arguments and denying her motion to open the judgment. She moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration on the same grounds. Thus, the issue of defendants' fraudulent conduct in the underlying foreclosure action was fully and fairly litigated and actually decided against Peterson. Moreover, that decision was necessary to the state court's ruling because a finding of fraud during the foreclosure proceedings otherwise would have warranted granting Peterson relief from judgment. See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Melahn, 85 A.3d 1, 5-7 (Conn. App. Ct. 2014) (observing court may set aside strict-foreclosure judgment based on fraud).
In sum, because Peterson failed on these issues in state court, she cannot relitigate them in federal court. The district court therefore properly dismissed the complaint.
While a district court generally should grant a pro se litigant leave to amend before dismissing the complaint, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave here because amendment would be futile. See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000). As Peterson was barred from asserting her claims, repleading would not cure the deficiencies in her complaint.
We have considered all of Peterson's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  Peterson also asserted claims for slander of title, quiet title, negligence, declaratory and injunctive relief, and violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq. Because Peterson does not raise any arguments in her brief regarding the district court's disposition of those claims, she has abandoned those claims on appeal. See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, 71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir. 1995).
[2]  On January 5, 2018, after this appeal had been submitted to the panel, Peterson moved to remand to the district court in light of a recent order of the Appellate Court of Connecticut directing the parties to submit additional briefing on whether Peterson's state appeals properly were dismissed as untimely. 2d Cir. 16-3635-cv, Dkt. No. 97. This alleged new evidence, however, does not disturb the district court's analysis or alter our decision to affirm. To the extent Peterson suggests that her still-pending state appeal negates application of the principles of preclusion, under Connecticut law, a pending appeal does not prevent application of res judicata or collateral estoppel. See LaBow v. Rubin, 897 A.2d 136, 143 (Conn. App. Ct. 2006). Accordingly, Peterson's motion to remand is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER

WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,
ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the March 9, 2017 Order of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED with instructions to grant Defendant-Appellant's motion to dismiss.
Defendant-Appellant Detective Edward J. Doyle appeals from a January 12, 2017 Order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Carter, J.), clarifying an Order of March 14, 2016, that denied Detective Doyle's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the basis of absolute and qualified immunity. Detective Doyle also appeals from a March 9, 2017 Order of the same court, denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.
We note at the outset that we do not possess jurisdiction to review the district court's January 12, 2017 Order. That Order merely clarified the court's March 14, 2016 Order denying Detective Doyle's motion to dismiss and did not ""alter the substantive rights affected by the first judgment."" In re Am. Safety Indem. Co., 502 F.3d 70, 72 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Farkas v. Rumore, 101 F.3d 20, 23 (2d Cir. 1996)). Accordingly, the 30-day deadline to file an appeal from the district court's denial of Detective Doyle's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss ran from March 14, 2016—the date of the first judgment on the motion. Detective Doyle's appeal of the January 12, 2017 Order is therefore untimely. We do have jurisdiction, however, over Detective Doyle's timely appeal from the March 9, 2017 Order denying his 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.
We review the denial of absolute or qualified immunity de novo. See Giraldo v. Kessler, 694 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir. 2012) (absolute immunity); Benzman v. Whitman, 523 F.3d 119, 125 (2d Cir. 2008) (qualified immunity). Under Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.S. 356, 369 (2012), a grand jury witness, including a law enforcement officer, ""has absolute immunity from any § 1983 claim based on the witness' testimony,"" even if that testimony is perjurious. Detective Doyle is entitled to absolute immunity in this case because plaintiff's claims are ""`based on'"" his allegedly false grand jury testimony, ""as that term is used in Rehberg."" Coggins v. Buonora, 776 F.3d 108, 113 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Rehberg, 566 U.S. at 369).
Accordingly, the March 9, 2017 Order of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED with instructions to grant Detective Doyle's motion to dismiss.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment entered on August 17, 2016, is AFFIRMED.
Trustee-Appellant John S. Pereira, as chapter 7 trustee (the ""Trustee"") for the estate of Thomas R. Heavey (""Heavey""), appeals from the district court's decision reversing, in part, a decision by the bankruptcy court finding that Creditor-Appellee 397 Realty LLC's (""397 Realty"") post-petition actions violated the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4). Before the bankruptcy court, the Trustee moved for summary judgment asserting that 397 Realty violated the automatic stay when 397 Realty's counsel ""contacted the Kings County Clerk"" to inquire why 397 Realty's timely filed but inexplicably undocketed lien extension order did not appear on the Kings County Clerk's docket. App'x at 126, ¶ 17.
""When a bankruptcy appeal reaches us after district court review of the bankruptcy court order, our review of the bankruptcy court order is plenary. In undertaking this plenary review, we independently review the factual determinations and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court, evaluating the bankruptcy court's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error."" In re N. New England Tel. Operations LLC, 795 F.3d 343, 346 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In so doing, we assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm the district court's decision.
The bankruptcy court found that 397 Realty's inquiry to the Kings County Clerk resulted in the post-petition docketing of a lien against estate property and constituted a sanctionable violation of 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4)'s automatic stay of ""any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate."" The district court disagreed, holding that a creditor violates § 362(a)(4) only if it is ""reasonably foreseeable"" that its act will result in the creation, perfection, or enforcement of a lien against property of the estate. App'x at 534. Because it was not reasonably foreseeable that the Kings County Clerk would act on 397 Realty's inquiry by docketing the extension order, the district court held that 397 Realty's inquiry did not violate the automatic stay.
This case, however, does not turn on reasonable foreseeability. 397 Realty's reflexive response did not violate the automatic stay because it was not an act to create, perfect, or enforce a lien against Heavey's property. Pursuant to the automatic stay provision, the filing of a bankruptcy petition ""operates as a stay of . . . any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate."" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4). While the adjective ""any"" suggests that Section 362(a)(4) paints with a broad brush, the statute also contains the descriptive infinitives ""to create, perfect, or enforce."" These infinitives describe the types of ""acts"" that the automatic stay prohibits. In other words, only acts to create, perfect, or enforce a lien against property of the estate violate the automatic stay.
Based on the facts that formed the basis of the Trustee's motion for summary judgment, 397 Realty's counsel merely asked the Kings County Clerk what happened to his timely filed extension order. On the facts before us, there is no indication that 397 Realty demanded that the Kings County Clerk correct its mistake, nor is there any evidence to suggest that 397 Realty engaged in anything more than a simple factfinding inquiry. Section 362(a)(4) does not prohibit all acts which coincidentally set in motion the creation, perfection, or enforcement of a lien. Rather, the prohibited, and thus compensable, act must be an act to create, to perfect, or to enforce a lien. Because 397 Realty engaged only in factfinding and did not attempt to create, perfect, or enforce its lien, 397 Realty did not violate the automatic stay.
In urging otherwise, the Trustee cites In Re Parr Meadows Racing Ass'n, 880 F.2d 1540 (2d Cir. 1989), for the proposition that a violation of the stay ""need not even be an `act' at all, but can be triggered without any action by the lienholder."" Appellant's Br. at 9. The facts of In Re Parr Meadows Racing Ass'n are distinguishable from the case at hand. Tax liens in favor of government entities that arise by operation of law are sui generis, carrying with them their own treatment and exemptions as government interests under Section 362. See 11 U.S.C. § 362(b). Furthermore, our holding there rested on our conclusion that the tax liens ""did not come passively into being `by operation of law'; rather, they were created and perfected as a direct result of the county's assessment and taxation process, which consists of several `affirmative acts' by county, town, and school district officers, administrators, and agents."" In Re Parr Meadows Racing Ass'n, 880 F.2d at 1545. Accordingly, In Re Parr Meadows Racing Ass'n does not upset our conclusion that 397 Realty did not take an affirmative act to create, perfect, or enforce a lien against Heavey's property.
We have considered the Trustee's remaining arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant the Incorporated Village of Old Westbury (""Village"") appeals from a March 31, 2017 order of the district court dismissing, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, its coverage claim against American Alternative Insurance Corporation (""AAIC""). The issue is whether the policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" includes mental injury. On appeal, the Village argues that the district court failed to apply Lavanant v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, 79 N.Y.2d 623 (1992), which held under the contract there at issue, that bodily injuries include purely mental injuries. The Village does not contest that it seeks indemnification under the AAIC policy in order to avoid absorbing the higher deductible in an Errors and Omissions policy issued to it by ACE North American (""ACE""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Sousa v. Marquez, 702 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (citation omitted).
We apply New York law in our construction of the term ""bodily injury."" See Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third Assocs., 14 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 1994) (""Federal courts sitting in diversity cases will, of course, apply the substantive law of the forum State on outcome determinative issues.""). ""In determining a dispute over insurance coverage, we first look to the language of the policy"" and ""construe the policy in a way that affords a fair meaning to all of the language employed by the parties in the contract and leaves no provision without force and effect."" Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 98 N.Y.2d 208, 221-22 (2002) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). ""As with the construction of contracts generally, unambiguous provisions of an insurance contract must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and the interpretation of such provisions is a question of law for the court."" Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bear Stearns Cos., 10 N.Y.3d 170, 177 (2008) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). But when an insurance contract term is ambiguous, ""a court may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties' intent at the formation of the contract."" Olin Corp. v. OneBeacon Am. Ins. Co., 864 F.3d 130, 148 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal citation omitted); see also Mostow v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 88 N.Y.2d 321, 326 (1996) (contract terms are ambiguous if ""the policy may be reasonably interpreted in two conflicting manners""). ""If the extrinsic evidence fails to establish the parties' intent, courts may apply other rules of contract interpretation, including New York's insurance-specific version of the rule of contra proferentem, according to which ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the insured."" Olin Corp., 864 F.3d at 148.
""Bodily injury"" is defined in the AAIC General Liability Policy as:
""Bodily injury"" means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person. This includes mental anguish, mental injury, shock, fright or death resulting from bodily injury, sickness or disease.
Joint App'x at 357. The district court concluded that the second sentence would be superfluous if ""bodily injury"" included purely mental injuries that were not directly caused by an independent physical bodily injury. We agree.
The Village relies on the New York Court of Appeals construction of ""bodily injury"" in Lavanant, 79 N.Y.2d 623, which concluded that purely mental injuries were bodily injuries under the contract at issue. However, the contract at issue in Lavanant did not limit coverage for mental injury to mental injury that results from bodily injury, as the contract at issue in this case does, and thus allow the inference that bodily and mental injury are distinct.
Accordingly, the order of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.

A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant Byron Rodas appeals from a judgment sua sponte dismissing his suit brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Rodas was enrolled in a Relapse Intervention for Sex Crimes (""RISC"") program run by Appellees. He was discharged from that program, which resulted in his imprisonment. In 2014, Rodas sued Appellees, asserting due process and equal protection claims stemming from his discharge from the program. The district court dismissed his complaint for failure to allege state action, and we dismissed his appeal as untimely. In 2016, Rodas again sued Appellees based on his discharge from the program. The district court sua sponte dismissed his complaint as barred by claim preclusion. This appeal followed. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review a district court's sua sponte 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) dismissal de novo, Giano v. Goord, 250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002), and conclude that the district court properly dismissed the complaint as claim precluded. A claim is precluded when ""(1) the previous action involved an adjudication on the merits; (2) the previous action involved the plaintiffs or those in privity with them; (3) the claims asserted in the subsequent action were, or could have been, raised in the prior action."" Monahan v. N.Y.C. Dept. of Corr., 214 F.3d 275, 285 (2d Cir. 2000). Pursuant to this three-prong test, the district court properly found that Rodas' 2014 action ended in an adjudication on the merits; that the 2014 action and the current one involved the same parties; and that both the 2014 action and the current one asserted constitutional claims under § 1983 based on Rodas' discharge from the RISC program.
Moreover, the Appellees' refusal to provide certain documents to Rodas following the termination of his 2014 action does not transform his present action into a ""new"" claim. Rodas argues in both actions that he had a liberty interest in staying in the RISC program—and thus out of jail—and Appellees deprived him of that interest without due process. Rodas has not established that he has a separate liberty interest in the documents he later tried to obtain from them.
We have considered Rodas' remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of the district court is REMANDED.
Morris Zukerman challenges the reasonableness of the sentence imposed after he entered into a plea agreement for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the due administration of the internal revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), and tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201. Zukerman was sentenced by the district court for the Southern District of New York (Torres, J.) on March 21, 2017, and judgment was entered that same day. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Zukerman's plea agreement stipulated that the Guidelines range for his sentence was 70 to 87 months' imprisonment and a fine of between $25,000 and $250,000, although it was further agreed that the parties could seek a sentence outside of the stipulated Guidelines range based upon the factors to be considered in the imposition of sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Cf. Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.S. 708, 714-15 (2008) (""Although the Guidelines, as the starting point and the initial benchmark, continue to play a role in the sentencing determination, there is no longer a limit . . . on the variances from Guidelines ranges that a district court may find justified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)."" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The Government subsequently sought a sentence consisting of ""a term of incarceration within the Stipulated Guidelines range"" and ""a substantial fine . . . through a substantial variance from the $25,000 to $250,000 Guidelines range,"" though the Government did not specify an amount or range for the fine it sought. App. 291, 322. Zukerman was sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment and fined $10 million. On appeal, Zukerman contends that the imposition of a $10 million fine was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable, without challenging the reasonableness of either his prison term or the restitution he has paid.
""We have declined to articulate precise standards for assessing whether a district court's explanation of its reason for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence is sufficient,"" United States v. Pereira, 465 F.3d 515, 524 (2d Cir. 2006), and ""are hesitant to require the district court to utter any specific incantation,"" United States v. Rattoballi, 452 F.3d 127, 138 (2d Cir. 2006). ""The particular weight to be afforded aggravating and mitigating factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge, with appellate courts seeking to ensure only that a factor can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in the case."" United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 289 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Nevertheless, district courts ""must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review,"" Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 50 (2007), and it remains ""`uncontroversial' . . . that a major variance from the Guidelines range `should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one,'"" United States v. Jones, 531 F.3d 163, 171-72 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 50).
Because the Guidelines ""covering `offenses involving taxation' . . . drastically vary as to the recommended sentence based simply on the amount of money involved,"" without a concomitant variation to reflect the ""wide variety of culpability amongst defendants,"" such sentences are ""reviewed especially deferentially"" to allow for sentencing disparities ""based on the factors identified in § 3553(a)."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 192 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). ""Although a judge need not utter robotic incantations repeating each factor that motivates a sentence,"" United States v. Park, 758 F.3d 193, 197 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted), we can only defer to a sentencing judge's justifications ""if adequately explained."" Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192. The district court endeavored to explain its reasoning orally at the sentencing hearing and in its written statement of reasons, but the record nevertheless remains unclear as to why and how it settled on $10 million as the fine amount: for example, the relative weight assigned to the various factors cited in its oral and written explanations; to what extent, if any, the district court considered the disparity between the sentence imposed on Zukerman and those imposed in other tax prosecutions; and the basis for its determination that a $10 million fine (in conjunction with other aspects of Zukerman's sentence) was ""sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes"" of criminal sentencing as required by § 3553(a).
At this stage, we believe this issue is best resolved by means of what is known in this Circuit as a Jacobson remand, in which we remand ""partial jurisdiction to the district court to supplement the record on a discrete factual or legal issue while retaining jurisdiction over the original appeal."" Corporacion Mexicana de Mantenimiento Integral, S. de R.L. de C.V. v. Pemex-Exploracion y Produccion, 832 F.3d 92, 115 (2d Cir. 2016) (Winter, J., concurring); see also United States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing the authority of federal appellate courts to seek ""supplementation of a record without a formal remand or the need for a new notice of appeal before the appellate panel acts on the supplemental record""). Accordingly, we direct the district court to elaborate on its rationale for imposing a fine greater than those typically imposed in tax prosecutions, and for the amount selected. Upon such elaboration by the district court, either party may restore the matter to the active docket of this Court by letter, without filing a new notice of appeal. In the event that either party seeks further action from this Court, the matter will be referred to this panel.
For the foregoing reasons, we hereby REMAND the judgment of the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the March 31, 2017 judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff Paul Ulrich, proceeding pro se, appeals from the dismissal of so much of his complaint against his former employer, Moody's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. (collectively, ""Moody's""), as alleged violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley (""SOX""), Dodd-Frank, and Sherman Antitrust Acts, and defamation and breach of his employment contract; and from the award of summary judgment to Moody's on claims of discrimination and retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA""). See Ulrich v. Moody's Corp., No. 13-CV-8 (VSB), 2014 WL 4977562 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) (granting dismissal in part); Ulrich v. Moody's Corp., No. 13-CV-8 (VSB), 2017 WL 1232709 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2017) (awarding summary judgment on remaining claims). We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
""We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). We review orders granting summary judgment de novo, assessing whether the district court properly concluded that no genuine dispute existed as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Sotomayor v. City of N.Y., 713 F.3d 163, 164 (2d Cir. 2013). We review the denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. See Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185 (2d Cir. 2012).
Upon independent review of the record, and for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge's March 31, 2014 Report and Recommendation (""R&R""), and the district court's September 30, 2014 and March 31, 2017 orders, we conclude that the district court properly ordered dismissal and summary judgment.
In challenging dismissal of his SOX and Dodd-Frank claims, Ulrich argues that his case is distinguishable from Liu Meng-Lin v. Siemens AG, 763 F.3d 175, 183 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that anti-retaliation provision of Dodd-Frank does not apply extraterritorially). We are not persuaded because, although Ulrich, a United States citizen who sometimes interacted with Moody's United States managers, did allege more connection with the United States than was evident in Liu, he was nevertheless an overseas permanent resident working for a foreign subsidiary of Moody's, and the alleged wrongdoing and protected activity took place outside the United States. In these circumstances, Liu compelled dismissal.
As to defamation, Ulrich argues that the district court applied the incorrect definition of malice to overcome the qualified privilege. He is wrong. See Ulrich v. Moody's Corp., 2014 WL 4977562, at *9 (stating that under Hong Kong law, malice requires plaintiff to show that ""statements were intended to injure him, or that the speaker lacked an honest belief in the truth of the statement"" (emphasis added)). Moreover, contrary to Ulrich's assertions, the record does not support his contention that statements made in his performance reviews were knowingly false. As for his breach of contract claims, Ulrich waived any challenge to dismissal by failing to object, despite appropriate warnings, to the R&R's recommendation that they be dismissed based on Ulrich's status as an at-will employee under New York law. Cf. Small v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir. 1989) (""[A] pro se party's failure to object to a magistrate's report and recommendation . . . does not operate as a waiver of the right to appellate review of the district court's adoption of the magistrate's recommendation unless the magistrate's report explicitly states that failure to object . . . will preclude appellate review.""). Finally, Ulrich's Sherman Act claims were properly dismissed for lack of antitrust standing. See Gatt Commc'ns, Inc. v. PMC Assocs., L.L.C., 711 F.3d 68, 76-81 (2d Cir. 2013) (discussing requirements for antitrust injury).
In challenging summary judgment on his ADEA claims, Ulrich faults the district court's presentation of the facts. On our own review, we identify no error in the district court's careful and fair recitation of the evidence presented on summary judgment. Nothing in the record supports the requisite causal connection between Ulrich's age and either his low pay or eventual termination. See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 180 (2009); Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways, Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 106, 111 (2d Cir. 2010). Further lacking is any evidence admitting a finding that Moody's reliance on well-documented negative feedback about Ulrich's job performance and insubordination was a pretext for retaliatory suspension and termination. See, e.g., Schnabel v. Abramson, 232 F.3d 83, 87-88 (2d Cir. 2000).
Finally, the district court acted well within its discretion in denying leave to amend. Ulrich had already been afforded opportunity to amend—and did so in response to Moody's first motion to dismiss. Nothing suggests further amendment would cure the deficiencies in Ulrich's amended complaint. See Yerdon v. Henry, 91 F.3d 370, 378 (2d Cir. 1996) (identifying no abuse of discretion where plaintiff had amended complaint once and did not submit proposed second amended complaint, and defendants had already moved to dismiss).
We have considered Ulrich's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
James Kommer brought this putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Batts, J.), alleging that the defendants' marketing of their product, ""Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit Orthotic Inserts,"" constitutes a deceptive business practice and false advertising under New York General Business Law (""GBL"") §§ 349 and 350. In essence, the complaint alleges that Kommer and other consumers were led to believe incorrectly that the orthotics—which they purchased in prepackaged sizes, over-the-counter at retail stores such as Walmart—were ""custom fit"" in the sense that they were ""individually designed for each [consumer's specific] feet."" App'x at 12. On motion of the defendants, the district court dismissed the request for injunctive relief for lack of Article III standing, and the balance of the complaint for failure to state a claim. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. Kommer challenges the district court's determination that he lacks Article III standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of himself and the putative class. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. We review that determination de novo. See Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 238 (2d Cir. 2016).
""A plaintiff seeking to represent a class must personally have standing"" to pursue ""each form of relief sought."" Id. at 239. A plaintiff ""lack[s] standing to pursue injunctive relief [if he is] unable to establish a `real or immediate threat' of injury."" Id. (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111-12 (1983)). ""[P]ast injuries . . . [therefore] do not confer standing to seek injunctive relief unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that []he is likely to be harmed again in the future in a similar way."" Id.
Kommer fails to ""establish a likelihood of [such] future. . . harm."" Id. ""Even assuming his past purchases of [Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit Orthotic Inserts] resulted in [an] injury. . ., he has not shown that he is likely to be subjected to further [injurious] sales"" of that sort because he ""fail[s] to allege that he intends to [purchase the offending product] in the future."" Id. As he concedes, ""now [that he] knows of Defendants' [alleged] deception and false advertising, . . . he is no longer likely to purchase another pair of Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit Orthotics Inserts ever again."" Appellant's Br. at 54. Accordingly, he has no standing under Article III to enjoin the defendants' sales practices, and the court properly deemed him precluded from seeking that relief.
2. Kommer challenges the district court's determination that his complaint fails to state a claim under GBL §§ 349 and 350. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). We review that determination de novo. See Nicosia, 834 F.3d at 230.
An independent review of the allegations and relevant state law confirms that the complaint fails to state a claim. This is so for substantially the reasons articulated in the district court's May 18, 2017 Memorandum and Order. See Kommer v. Bayer Consumer Health, 252 F. Supp. 3d 304, 310-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). In particular, the complaint fails to plausibly allege that the defendants engaged in conduct ""likely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances,"" a required element of both claimed violations of the GBL. Orlander v. Staples, Inc., 802 F.3d 289, 300 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Cohen v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., 498 F.3d 111, 126 (2d Cir. 2007)). The court therefore properly dismissed the case.
We have considered Kommer's arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Joyelle Bukowski, pro se, filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a state family court judge, her child's law guardian, an attorney for New York Child Protective Services (""CPS""), three CPS workers, the father of her child, and the father's attorney, arguing that she suffered various constitutional injuries arising from temporary state-court orders related to her custody and visitation rights. The district court sua sponte dismissed Bukowski's complaint (without leave to amend) under both the domestic-relations exception to federal subject-matter jurisdiction and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). Bukowski appeals. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues presented for review.
1. We review the district court's dismissal of Bukowski's complaint—under both the domestic relations exception and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine—de novo. See Liranzo v. United States, 690 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir. 2012). We may affirm the dismissal on either ground relied on by the district court, but we are also ""free to affirm on any ground that finds support in the record."" Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP, 854 F.3d 150, 160 n.6 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Headley v. Tilghman, 53 F.3d 472, 476 (2d Cir. 1995)).
We affirm the dismissal of Bukowski's complaint on the ground that federal-court abstention is required under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), insofar as Bukowski seeks declaratory or injunctive relief that would interfere with a ""[s]tate court's ability to perform its judicial function in . . . [an ongoing] custody proceeding[]."" Falco v. Justices of the Matrimonial Parts of Supreme Court of Suffolk Cty., 805 F.3d 425, 428 (2d Cir. 2015), cert. denied sub nom. Falco v. Justices of the Matrimonial Parts of the Supreme Court of Suffolk Cty., 136 S. Ct. 2469 (2016).
To the extent that Bukowski also seeks monetary damages, we decline to stay her federal suit pending resolution of the state proceeding because Bukowski's claims for damages plainly fail. See Kirschner v. Klemons, 225 F.3d 227, 238 (2d Cir. 2000). Bukowski failed to raise any allegations against defendants Kathleen Turner and Dennis Brown. See Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, 375 F.3d 206, 229 (2d Cir. 2004). Absolute immunity defeats the claims against Jeffrey Tavel (CPS's prosecutor), Jeffrey Spinner (the family court judge), Lori Towns (a CPS worker who testified against Bukowski), and Joanne Merrihue (another CPS worker who testified). See Cornejo v. Bell, 592 F.3d 121, 127-28 (2d Cir. 2010) (prosecutors); Bliven v. Hunt, 579 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 2009) (judges); Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 345 (1983) (witnesses). To the extent that Bukowski attempts to state against any of those defendants a claim that is not barred by absolute immunity, see Dory v. Ryan, 25 F.3d 81, 83 (2d Cir. 1994), she fails, see Zemesky v. City of New York, 821 F.2d 148, 151 (2d Cir. 1987). Finally, the claims against Adam Saylor (the father of Bukowski's child), Philip Castrovinci (Saylor's lawyer), and Mary Beth Daniels (the child's law guardian)—which Bukowski brought under § 1983—must be dismissed because none of those defendants is a state actor, see Milan v. Wertheimer, 808 F.3d 961, 964 (2d Cir. 2015), and Bukowski's oblique reference to those private actors conspiring with CPS to deprive her of her child is fatally conclusory or otherwise unsupported, see Ciambriello v. Cnty. of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307, 324 (2d Cir. 2002). Bukowski's complaint was properly dismissed.
2. We review de novo the district court's decision to deny Bukowski leave to amend on the ground that amendment would be futile. See Smith v. Hogan, 794 F.3d 249, 253 (2d Cir. 2015). Notwithstanding the solicitude accorded to pro se plaintiffs, the court's decision was proper because the complaint, read liberally, ""suggests that [Bukowski lacks] a claim"" rather than merely ""that she has inadequately or inartfully pleaded."" Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000).
We have considered all of Bukowski's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED in part.[1]
Plaintiff-Appellant Curtis Hardaway appeals from the August 31, 2016 judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Hall, C.J., Merriam, M.J.), dismissing his third amended complaint alleging various claims against the City of Hartford, the Hartford Department of Public Works (the ""Department""), and five Doe defendants. Hardaway, an African American and former employee of the Department, alleged that he was subjected to discrimination and retaliation after he filed complaints against the Department with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (""OSHA""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.
We review de novo a district court's sua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). Giano v. Goord, 250 F.3d 146, 149-150 (2d Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002). To avoid dismissal, a complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). We afford a pro se litigant ""special solicitude"" by interpreting a complaint filed pro se ""to raise the strongest claims that it suggests."" Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal punctuation omitted). ""A pro se complaint should not be dismissed without the Court granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated."" Nielsen v. Rabin, 746 F.3d 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162, 170 (2d Cir. 2010)).
We affirm the dismissal of Hardaway's Section 1981 and state law intentional infliction of emotional distress for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in the July 5, 2016 and August 1, 2016 recommended rulings. ""When a defendant sued for discrimination under §§ 1981 or 1983 is a municipality, the plaintiff is required to show that the challenged acts were performed pursuant to a municipal policy or custom."" Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 314 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Patterson v. Cty. of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206, 226 (2d Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In its review of Hardaway's second amended complaint, the district court informed Hardaway that he had not pled sufficient facts for municipal liability to attach under Section 1981. In his third amended complaint, Hardaway failed to plead additional information regarding a municipal policy or custom. Under such circumstances, we see no error in the district court's dismissal of Hardaway's Section 1981 claim with prejudice.
The district court also correctly determined that Hardaway's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was barred by Connecticut law as against the municipality, and that there was no viable claim against another defendant. See Huaman v. Sirois, No. 13CV484 (DJS), 2015 WL 5797005, at *19 (D. Conn. Sept. 30, 2015) (""Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-557n bars claims against municipalities based on willful misconduct, and therefore plaintiffs cannot use § 52-557n to hold municipalities liable for the intentional misconduct of municipal employees."").
Hardaway argues that the district court erred by neglecting to analyze his claims under the First Amendment. We disagree. ""[T]he submissions of a pro se litigant must be construed liberally."" Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Pabon v. Wright, 459 F.3d 241, 248 (2d Cir. 2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But ""[d]istrict judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se litigants."" Pliler v. Ford, 542 U.S. 225, 231 (2004). After Hardaway filed his initial complaint on January 26, 2016, he filed a total of three amended complaints responding to various points raised by the district court. In his initial complaint, Hardaway alleged one count of ""15 U.S. Code § 2087 OSHA/Whistleblower Retaliation."" In its review of that initial complaint, the district court noted that ""the facts alleged could be read to state a First Amendment retaliation claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983,"" but found that Hardaway had failed to name an entity amenable to suit. Recommended Ruling at 4, Hardaway v. Hartford Public Works Dep't, No. 16-cv-00115 (D. Conn. Feb. 26, 2016) (ECF No. 13), adopted by order Mar. 18, 2016 (ECF No. 17). Hardaway never included a First Amendment charge in his subsequent complaints, nor did he name an entity amendable to suit until his second amended complaint. Given Hardaway's failure to raise a First Amendment retaliation claim in his many revised complaints, despite suggestion from the district court that such a claim might be viable, we conclude that the district court did not err by declining to construe Hardaway's third amended complaint to raise such a claim. Further, even if the district court had analyzed Hardaway's claims under the First Amendment, Hardaway alleged no facts indicating that he ""spoke as citizens on a matter of public concern"" in his complaints to OSHA, as required for a public employee to maintain a First Amendment retaliation claim. Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir. 2008).
We have considered the remainder of Hardaway's arguments, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, with respect to Hardaway's Section 1981 claim, Count II of the third amended complaint, and his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, Count IV, the order of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.
[1]  In a separate opinion filed concurrently with this summary order, we reverse the district court's holdings as to Hardaway's Title VII and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims, Counts I, II and V of the third amended complaint.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment entered on December 21, 2016, is AFFIRMED.
Defendant Raymond James was convicted based on his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). He appeals the resulting 27-month, within-Guidelines prison sentence as substantively unreasonable. We apply ""a particularly deferential form of abuse-of-discretion review"" to such a challenge. United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 188 n.5 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc); accord United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 278 (2d Cir. 2012). In so doing, we assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
In arguing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, James bears a heavy burden because we will set aside a sentence on that ground ""only in exceptional cases"" where the challenged sentence cannot be located within the wide range of permissible decisions available to the district court, United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189, that is, where ""the sentence imposed was shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law,"" United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2009). That is not this case.
While we do not presume that James's 27-month sentence is substantively reasonable simply because it falls within his 24-to-30-month Guidelines range, ""we recognize that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances."" United States v. Ryan, 806 F.3d 691, 695 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). No different conclusion is warranted here. In determining that a 27-month sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the statutory objectives of federal sentencing, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the district court considered mitigating factors, including James's prospects for rehabilitation. It also considered, however, James's lengthy criminal history, including his ""history of possessing firearms and using them in connection with crimes,"" concluding that ""an appropriate custodial sentence"" was necessary to promote ""respect for the law,"" as well as ""to deter him"" and ""to deter others."" App'x 55. On this record, we cannot conclude that a within-Guidelines 27-month sentence was outside the ""broad range"" of sentences available to the district court so as to be considered substantively reasonable. United States v. Jones, 531 F.3d 163, 174 (2d Cir. 2008).
In urging otherwise, James faults the district court for acknowledging that incarceration had not successfully deterred him from criminal activity in the past, but nevertheless imposing the 27-month prison term ""mainly for the purposes of specific deterrence."" Appellant's Br. at 10. The argument that defiant recidivism should somehow mitigate a sentence below the Guidelines range borders on the absurd. In any event, ""[t]he particular weight to be afforded aggravating and mitigating factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge,"" United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 289 (internal quotation marks omitted), and thus ""we do not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor,"" but rather ""whether the factor, as explained by the district court, can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in the case,"" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191; see United States v. Perez-Frias, 636 F.3d 39, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2011) (recognizing ""[g]enerally, if the ultimate sentence is reasonable and the sentencing judge did not commit procedural error in imposing that sentence, we will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the judge accorded to a given factor or to a specific argument made pursuant to that factor"" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). In light of the district court's finding here that James ""doesn't seem to be affected by the punishments he has incurred in the past,"" and, in particular, that he ""committed his crime while on parole, fresh from jail,"" App'x 55, we cannot conclude that the district court placed more weight on the need ""to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,"" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C), than that sentencing factor can bear under the totality of the circumstances. In sum, we identify no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination that James's failure to ""learn his lesson,"" App'x 49, and to conform his conduct to the law despite previous terms of incarceration heightened rather than minimized the need for specific deterrence.
We have considered James's other arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Joanna Fan appeals the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York denying her motion to reconsider the denial of bail pending resolution of her motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Fan pled guilty to embezzling funds from a federal school lunch program in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A)(i). In her plea agreement, Fan
agree[d] not to file an appeal or otherwise challenge, by petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or any other provision, the conviction or sentence in the event that the Court imposes a term of imprisonment of 78 months or below.
App'x at 76. The waiver is binding and bars appeal from any forfeiture award imposed for any amount at or less than $3 million. Id. at 94-95. Fan confirmed at her plea colloquy that she understood the plea agreement. Id. at 63, 69-70, 73, 76. The Government's Stipulations, which Fan did not oppose, recommended a Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months and a loss amount exceeding $2.5 million. In October 2013, the district court sentenced Fan to 57 months' imprisonment and forfeiture of $3 million.
Fan appealed her conviction and sentence. This Court found the appellate waiver contained in Fan's plea agreement enforceable and dismissed the appeal. United States v. Fan, No. 13-3924, Dkt. No. 160 (2d Cir. Oct. 17, 2014). In June 2015, Fan filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 alleging ineffective assistance because, among other reasons, her counsel failed to inform the court that Fan was not waiving her right to contest the loss amount. Fan's request for bail pending the resolution of her habeas petition was denied from the bench. Before the district court could rule on her § 2255 action, Fan moved for additional discovery to expand the record. The court granted limited discovery in the form of a subpoena to the Department of Agriculture, but the Government moved to quash to the extent the subpoena implicated certain privileges. While that motion was pending, Fan made a third request for bail, which was denied. The district court then denied Fan's subsequent request for reconsideration of the denial of the third bail motion, leading to this appeal.
We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. Harris v. Kuhlmann, 346 F.3d 330, 357 (2d Cir. 2003). The standard for reconsideration is ""strict,"" and it should be granted only if the moving party ""can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked."" Shrader v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Reconsideration is not intended for the court to reexamine a decision or the party to reframe a failed motion. See Questrom v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., 192 F.R.D. 128, 130 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).
Fan identifies no question of overlooked law or fact that could overcome the multiple layers of deference we apply to a district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration of bail in an action alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Calley v. Callaway, 496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir. 1974) (requiring ""extraordinary or exceptional circumstances"" to justify the grant of bail pending habeas). The standard is particularly difficult to satisfy because Fan's arguments on the motion for reconsideration relate to the performance of her sentencing counsel and are thus foreclosed by a valid appellate waiver that bars collateral attack via a § 2255 petition.[1] See Garcia-Santos v. United States, 273 F.3d 506, 509 (2d Cir. 2001) (per curiam).
Fan also misconstrues the issues on appeal, rendering her remaining arguments inapplicable to this case. Fan's good character, the absence of flight risk, and the risk of irreparable prejudice may bear upon the merits of a bail motion, but not the instant motion for reconsideration. See Malik v. McGinnis, 293 F.3d 559, 561 (2d Cir. 2002) (The appeal of an order denying a motion for reconsideration ""brings up for review only the denial of the motion and not the merits of the underlying judgment.""). Fan's chief contention is that as a matter of arithmetic, any resentencing would likely result in a release date that has already passed. The district court already considered and rejected this argument both when considering bail and on the motion for reconsideration. The court was not persuaded that extraordinary circumstances warranted bail, and Fan could not show that she would be entitled to a lower sentence even if the Sentencing Guidelines range were lowered.
Nothing presented on this appeal calls these decisions into question because there is no new information going to the merits of Fan's bail motion that was overlooked by the district court. Even adopting the modifications to the loss amount that Fan suggests she could receive in the highly remote event that she prevailed on her underlying post-plea ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court could ultimately resentence her for the same duration. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration.
For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Fan's other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  While the Government does not seek to enforce Fan's collateral attack waiver with respect to claims of pre-plea ineffectiveness, Fan's arguments on her motion for reconsideration address only her claims post-plea ineffectiveness, i.e., the performance of sentencing counsel. Her chances of succeeding on such ineffectiveness claims appear low, which also justifies the denial of the motion for reconsideration. See Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 n.5 (2d Cir. 2001) (""Bail is appropriate pending a decision in a habeas case only when the petitioner has raised substantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of success . . ."")

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.
The City of New York and the individual defendants, former Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly of the New York City Police Department (""NYPD"") and NYPD Sergeant Daniel J. Sweeney, appeal from a June 26, 2015 judgment and a March 1, 2016 order of the District Court (Carter, J.) partially denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law and denying their motion for a new trial. Plaintiffs Kathleen Makinen and Jamie Nardini cross-appeal from an award of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on certain of plaintiffs' claims. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, as set forth in our prior decision in Makinen v. City of New York, 857 F.3d 491 (2d Cir. 2017), to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm in part and reverse in part.
1. Defendants' Appeal
On appeal, the defendants argue primarily that the plaintiffs' New York City Human Rights Law (""NYCHRL"") claims are barred by the plain text of the NYCHRL because the plaintiffs were not (and were not perceived to be) recovered or recovering alcoholics. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(16)(c). Finding that the appeal raised an important unsettled question of New York law, we certified to the New York Court of Appeals the following question: ""Do sections 8-102(16)(c) and 8-107(1)(a) of the New York Administrative Code preclude a plaintiff from bringing a disability discrimination claim based solely on a perception of untreated alcoholism?"" Makinen, 857 F.3d at 497. By decision dated October 17, 2017, the Court of Appeals ""answer[ed] the certified question in the affirmative,"" concluding that ""the Administrative Code does not consider a mistaken perception of alcoholism to be a disability covered by the NYCHRL."" Makinen v. City of N.Y., 30 N.Y.3d 81, 83, 89 (2017). The Court of Appeals' answer to the certified question is dispositive of the defendants' appeal and renders the remaining issues in that appeal moot. We therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court with respect to the NYCHRL claims of both plaintiffs.
2. Plaintiffs' Cross-Appeal
a. FLSA
On cross-appeal, Makinen argues that the District Court erred in dismissing her claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., to compensate her for time spent in mandated alcohol treatment. We disagree. The time Makinen spent in outpatient rehabilitation sessions, private counseling sessions, and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings was not an ""integral and indispensable part of [her] principal activities"" as a police officer and therefore not compensable ""work"" under the FLSA. Chao v. Gotham Registry, Inc., 514 F.3d 280, 285 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Integrity Staffing Sols., Inc. v. Busk, 135 S. Ct. 513, 519 (2014) (""The integral and indispensable test is tied to the productive work that the employee is employed to perform.""). Accordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Makinen's FLSA claim.
b. Constructive Discharge
We also reject the plaintiffs' contention that the District Court erred in dismissing Makinen's constructive discharge claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law (""NYSHRL""), N.Y. Exec. Law § 290 et seq. To succeed on a constructive discharge claim, an employee must ""show both (1) that there is evidence of the employer's intent to create an intolerable environment that forces the employee to resign, and (2) that . . . a reasonable person would have found the work conditions so intolerable that he would have felt compelled to resign."" Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Israel of N.Y., 867 F.3d 298, 308 (2d Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted). Makinen did not show that the Counseling Services Unit (""CSU"") process was objectively intolerable. See Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 230 (2d Cir. 2004). Makinen remained on the force for several years after her initial alcoholism diagnosis and nearly a year after the imposition of her final treatment plan, retiring only after she reached her twentieth year of service and became qualified for pension benefits. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Makinen's working conditions were so intolerable that she was ""compelled"" to retire. Shultz, 867 F.3d at 308; see Spence v. Md. Cas. Co., 995 F.2d 1147, 1156 (2d Cir. 1993).
c. ADA and NYSHRL
Finally, Nardini asserts that she raised a genuine dispute of material fact about whether she suffered an adverse employment action because of her perceived disability. Even though imposing a probationary period on an employee could, under certain circumstances, constitute an adverse employment action, we reject Nardini's argument that her treatment in this case was ""akin to a form of probation."" Appellees' Br. 57. Although there is record evidence that Nardini will be re-referred to the CSU if NYPD officials conclude she has consumed alcohol, Nardini failed to show that this referral alone would ""materially . . . change . . . the terms and conditions"" of her employment. Sanders v. N.Y.C. Human Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004). Indeed, the NYPD's Patrol Guide[1] makes clear that referral to the CSU does ""not jeopardize [an officer's] promotional opportunities"" or ordinarily change her ""current assignments."" NYPD Patrol Guide § 203-04. We therefore agree with the District Court that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Nardini's ADA and NYSHRL claims.
We have considered the plaintiffs' remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.
[1]  Although our conclusion does not depend on our doing so, we take judicial notice of the Patrol Guide pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201.

Ramon Morales appeals from the September 23, 2014 judgment of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Furman, J.), following Morales's plea of guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and one count of using and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). Morales was sentenced principally to 216 months' imprisonment. We held this case pending decisions by the Supreme Court in Beckles v. United States, 137 S.Ct. 886 (2017), and our Court in United States v. Jones, 2017 WL 4456719 (2d Cir. 2017), as amended October 5, 2017. The parties submitted supplemental briefing on the issues of (1) whether, in light of the appeal waiver contained in the plea agreement, Morales may challenge the district court's determination that Morales qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1; and (2) whether, following Jones, a conviction for robbery in the third degree in New York is a ""crime of violence"" for purposes of determining whether a defendant is a career offender under the Guidelines. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.
As part of his plea agreement with the government, Morales agreed that that he would not file a direct appeal, mount a collateral challenge, or seek a sentence modification of any sentence imposed on him within or below the stipulated Guideline range of 322 to 387 months. He was sentenced to 216 months' imprisonment—well under the stipulated range—such that his appellate waiver is binding absent some breach of that agreement. See, e.g., United States v. Salcido-Contreras, 990 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting that ""knowing and voluntary waivers of a defendant's right to appeal a sentence within an agreed Guidelines range are enforceable""). Morales argues that the government breached the plea agreement by advocating for a higher drug quantity than set forth in the agreement in violation of its agreement not to do so.
Plea agreements are construed strictly against the government, and the court does not ""hesitate to scrutinize the government's conduct to ensure that it comports with the highest standard of fairness."" United States v. Lawlor, 168 F.3d 633, 637 (2d Cir. 1999). ""To determine whether a plea agreement has been breached, we `look[ ] to the reasonable understanding of the parties as to the terms of the agreement.'"" United States v. Riera, 298 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v. Colon, 220 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir. 2000)). ""When the Government breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is entitled to either withdraw his plea or have his agreement specifically performed."" United States v. Cimino, 381 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2004).
In urging that we find a breach, Morales relies heavily on our summary order in United States v. Robinson, 634 F. App'x 47 (2d Cir. Jan. 15, 2016). There, we found that the government breached a similar plea agreement with one of Morales's codefendants when, in its sentencing submission and at sentencing, it described Robinson as an active and managing member of a high-volume drug crew. Id. at 50. We found the breach was not de minimis, as:
The government's breach of the plea agreement directly affected the sentence. The district judge had not previously raised the possibility of a role enhancement, and specifically noted that the question had not occurred to him until after he read the government's September 3 sentencing letter. The court then proceeded to apply the enhancement.
Id. at 51 (internal citation omitted). We then vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing before a different judge.
Morales, by virtue of being sentenced after Robinson and other codefendants, stands on a different footing. By the time Morales was sentenced, the district court raised the issue of drug quantity and leadership in other sentencing proceedings, such that the government legitimately anticipated the district court's questions on the issue. Because the government simply responded to questions that the court had already asked in related sentencing proceedings, did not advocate for a higher sentence, and did not influence the court's factual understanding of the amount of crack attributable to the conspiracy, its sentencing submission did not run afoul of the plea agreement. As a result, Morales's appeal waiver remains in place and bars the various claims he raises before this Court.
We have considered the remainder of Morales's arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant 6801 Realty Co., LLC (""6801 Realty"") sued, inter alia, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (""USCIS"") under the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), challenging USCIS's denial of an H-1B visa. After 6801 Realty filed its complaint, USCIS sua sponte reopened the application and requested additional evidence. The district court granted summary judgment sua sponte to the Defendants-Appellees, concluding that USCIS's decision to reopen 6801 Realty's visa application rendered the agency's decision non-final and unreviewable under the APA.[1] We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Upon notice and a reasonable time to respond, a district court may grant summary judgment sua sponte ""after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(3).[2] We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, with the view that summary judgment is appropriate only ""if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Sousa v. Marquez, 702 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).
Under the APA, a court may review federal agency action only if there is a statute permitting such review or if the challenged decision is the ""final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court."" 5 U.S.C. § 704. Finality is satisfied by two conditions: ""First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow."" Salazar v. King, 822 F.3d 61, 82 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)). ""For the second prong, the core question is whether the result of [the agency's decisionmaking] process is one that will directly affect the parties."" Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""The Supreme Court has interpreted the finality element in a `pragmatic way.'"" Id. (quoting Sharkey v. Quarantillo, 541 F.3d 75, 88 (2d Cir. 2008)).
Although the possibility that an agency may later reconsider a decision does not affect a decision's finality, see Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 127 (2012), USCIS's reopening rendered the initial visa denial non-final. The reopening was not an informal revision that offered a mere possibility of success; USCIS actually reopened the decision and actively sought new evidence. Cf. id. (explaining that agency decision was final despite permitting petitioners to ""engage in informal discussion"" about the decision). Nor was the agency's action inappropriate. It identified issues with the original decision and areas that warranted further evidentiary development. As a result, USCIS's decision to reopen nullified the prior denial and left nothing for the district court to review.
6801 Realty also argues that the district court erred by denying its request to amend the complaint. We conclude that this argument is unavailing. 6801 Realty asserts that USCIS violated its own regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(5)(ii), when it sua sponte reopened 6801 Realty's H-1B visa application. To the extent that 6801 Realty argues these new allegations would demonstrate that there was ""final agency action,"" it is incorrect. The regulation in question simply permits a USCIS officer to reconsider a decision on applications like 6801 Realty's, and provides that the agency must allow the applicant a period of thirty days to submit new evidence regarding the application. See id. Thus, USCIS proceeded properly when it reopened 6801 Realty's case, requested additional evidence, and waited for the applicant's response before taking further action.
6801 Realty suggests that we should interpret the regulation, which refers to a USCIS officer's ""motion"" to reopen the case, to require that USCIS permit briefing on whether to reopen an application. Read in context, the regulation's use of ""motion"" does not contemplate such briefing, but rather allows ""the affected party [thirty] days after service of the motion to submit a brief."" Id. In light of the regulation's surrounding text, ""motion"" here refers to the officer's decision to reopen the case, and is not an invitation for an applicant to argue whether USCIS should reopen the case. Thus, the district court did not err in issuing summary judgment without allowing 6801 Realty to amend its complaint, because the company's proposed amendment would have been futile—it would not have changed our conclusion that there is no ""final agency action,"" as required by 5 U.S.C. § 704. See Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185-86 (2d Cir. 2012).
We have considered all of 6801 Realty's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[*]   The Clerk of Court is directed to amend the caption as set forth above.
[1]  Prior to granting summary judgment, the district court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the APA's requirement of ""final agency action"" is not jurisdictional. As we have previously observed, whether the APA's ""final agency action"" requirement, 5 U.S.C. § 704, is jurisdictional is an open question in our Circuit. See Sharkey v. Quarantillo, 541 F.3d 75, 87-88 (2d Cir. 2008). We need not decide that complex question here, which the parties have not briefed, as we conclude that § 704 is a question of ""statutory standing"" that permits ""resolving the case on threshold, non-merits grounds."" In re Facebook, Inc., Initial Pub. Offering Derivative Litig., 797 F.3d 148, 156 n.6 (2d Cir. 2015); see also Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 831 (1999); Long Term Care Partners, LLC v. United States, 516 F.3d 225, 233 (4th Cir. 2008) (resolving question of whether there was final agency action as a matter of statutory standing, where the jurisdictional inquiry would be ""difficult to resolve"").
[2]  As required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(3), the district court notified 6801 Realty that it was considering summary judgment and granted the company an opportunity to put forth evidence that there was a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether there was final agency action in this case. 6801 Realty responded by filing a memorandum opposing dismissal, attaching two exhibits to support its position.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the January 9, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part.
Defendant Jeffrey Betts (""defendant"" or ""Betts"") appeals from a December 7, 2016 judgment in which he was sentenced to a term of ten months' imprisonment and four years of supervised release. This sentence resulted from defendant's multiple violations while on supervised release for a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349. He was originally sentenced to 24 months in prison, followed by five years' supervised release. He was released from prison and began his initial term of supervised release on August 2, 2013. The violations for which defendant was most recently sentenced included two arrests for driving without a license and failure to make required restitution payments in the amount of ten percent of his gross monthly income. On November 28, 2016, after being remanded to the custody of the United States Marshals Service, defendant appeared before the District Court and admitted to violation number 3 (failure to notify his probation officer within 72 hours of being arrested), based on his July 29, 2016 arrest for driving without a license. Betts pleaded guilty to this violation pursuant to a plea agreement, which anticipated a Guidelines range of imprisonment of 4 to 10 months. The Agreement also provided that Betts would be subject to a maximum term of supervised release of five years, less any term of imprisonment imposed on his supervised release revocation.
In addition to sentencing Betts to ten months' imprisonment and four years of supervised release, the District Court imposed special conditions of supervised release. The District Court ordered that the defendant refrain from consuming any alcohol whatsoever while under supervision. It also required substance abuse testing, stating that ""[t]here will be zero tolerance of the use of any drugs at all."" J.A. at 154 (emphasis added). Betts now argues that this newly imposed sentence of four years of supervised release is substantively unreasonable. He also argues that the District Court erred in imposing the special conditions relating to alcohol and drugs. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
I
We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness under a ""deferential abuse-of-discretion standard."" Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007); see also United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 278 (2d Cir. 2012) (""our standard is `reasonableness,' `a particularly deferential form of abuse-of-discretion review.'""). A sentence is substantively unreasonable ""only if it cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" United States v. Bonilla, 618 F.3d 102, 108 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As we have observed before, ""in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances."" United States v. Fernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir. 2006) (abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 364 (2007)).
Betts argues that his sentence of four years of supervised release was substantively unreasonable for three reasons. He first contends that his violation was not sufficiently egregious to warrant an additional four-year term of supervised release. This argument lacks merit. The District Court carefully reviewed the factual basis for defendant's violation, as well as his history and characteristics, before concluding that a four-year term of supervised release was warranted. The District Court considered, among other factors, defendant's repeated failure to make restitution payments despite his earning an income, and the fact that the defendant absconded from supervision for two months after being arrested. The District Court repeatedly noted a concern that this behavior indicated a disregard on the part of the defendant of the consequences of violating the law.
Defendant next argues that the District Court abused its discretion in sentencing him to a term at the upper end of the Guidelines range. We also reject this argument. As previously noted, a sentence within the Guidelines is presumptively reasonable. Both the imposed term of imprisonment and the term of supervised release were within the permissible Guidelines range, and a sentence on the upper end of the Guidelines falls comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances given defendant's behavior while on supervised release.
Last, we reject defendant's contention that the District Court erred in discrediting some of defense counsel's mitigation arguments. The District Court was not persuaded by some of defense counsel's claims that defendant was taking serious steps to behave better because the Court found these statements to be contradicted by defendant's actions. The District Court's decision to weigh the evidence as it did was not an abuse of discretion.
Upon review of the record, we find that all of defendant's challenges to the substantive reasonableness of the imposition of a four-year term of supervised release are without merit.
II
We now turn to defendant's claim that the District Court's imposition of extra special conditions of supervised release constituted procedural error. We first address the District Court's total prohibition of alcohol use and then its requirement that defendant submit to substance abuse testing with zero tolerance for the use of any drugs.
District courts possess broad discretion in imposing conditions of supervised release. A sentencing court may impose special conditions that are reasonably related to ""the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;"" ""the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;"" ""the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;"" and ""the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner,"" and which ""involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary"" for these purposes. U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b); see also United States v. Myers, 426 F.3d 117, 123-25 (2d Cir. 2005). A district court's discretion to impose special conditions is not ""untrammeled,"" however, and we will ""carefully scrutinize unusual and severe conditions."" Myers, 426 F.3d at 124 (internal quotation marks omitted).
A district court is required to make an individualized assessment when determining whether to impose a special condition of supervised release and to state on the record the reason for imposing it; the failure to do so is plain error. In the absence of such an explanation, we may uphold the condition imposed only if the district court's reasoning is ""self-evident in the record."" United States v. Balon, 384 F.3d 38, 41 n.1 (2d Cir. 2004). But it is also clear that the conditions must be ""reasonably related"" to the sentencing objectives. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). See also United States v. Reeves, 591 F.3d 77 (2d Cir. 2010) (vacating an imposed special condition that required a defendant convicted of possession of child pornography to notify the Probation Department when he established a ""significant romantic relationship"" and to inform his partner of his criminal history because it was not reasonably related to sentencing objectives).
Defendant principally argues that a special condition prohibiting all alcohol use is not reasonably related to either his underlying crime or his admitted violation, and that the ban involves a greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary to achieve sentencing goals. After examining the record, we agree. Neither defendant's underlying crime nor any of the conduct contributing to his violations of supervised release involved the use of alcohol. The District Court was not presented with any evidence suggesting that the defendant ever seriously abused alcohol. The District Court also gave no reason for imposing this special condition, beyond a clearly stated displeasure with the defendant's performance while on supervised release. Given the factual record below, the standard condition limiting ""excessive use"" of alcohol, which was also included in defendant's judgment, is sufficient to further the objectives of sentencing. We thus find that the special condition banning all alcohol use is not reasonably related to any of the factors outlined in Section 5D1.3(b), and necessitates vacatur.
Defendant next urges us to vacate the District Court's special condition requiring substance abuse testing with ""zero tolerance of the use of any drugs at all."" He claims the condition constituted a complete ban on all drugs, including those prescribed by a physician, and was thus error. Though inartfully worded, this special condition does not prevent the defendant from using lawful drugs. Defendant's judgment also included the standard condition that he ""shall not purchase, possess, use, distribute, or administer any controlled substance or any paraphernalia related to any controlled substances, except as prescribed by a physician."" J.A. at 160. When read in conjunction with this standard condition of supervision, it is clear that the imposed ""zero tolerance"" policy is meant to apply only to the use of controlled substances. So read, the condition is appropriate and we will not vacate it.
CONCLUSION
We have considered all of defendant's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the District Court's imposition of a four-year term of supervised release, as well as the District Court's imposition of a special condition requiring periodic testing for use of controlled substances without a prescription. We VACATE the special condition prohibiting all use of alcohol and REMAND the case to the District Court for further consideration of whether it is necessary to impose any special conditions related to alcohol use and, if so, for the court to explain the basis for imposing them in light of the factors listed in Section 5D1.3(b).

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the February 6, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Joseph S. Barone appeals from a February 6, 2017 judgment in favor of defendants-appellees United States of America and FBI Special Agents Michael Gaeta, Gregory Miceli, and Michael Trombetta (""Defendants""). This case stems from Barone's arrest and prosecution for involvement in an alleged murder-for-hire plot. After the government failed to attain a conviction, Barone brought various claims against Defendants under the Federal Tort Claims Act (""FTCA""), 28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq., and Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) (""Bivens""). The District Court dismissed some claims and later granted summary judgment to Defendants on the balance. Upon review, we affirm. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
BACKGROUND
I. Barone's History as an FBI Source and the Murder for Hire Plot
In 1993, Barone became what is today known as a ""confidential human source"" for the FBI, and for years served the agency by gathering evidence against some of New York's organized crime families. During Barone's time as a confidential human source, the FBI occasionally granted him authorization to commit ""otherwise illegal activity,"" or ""OIA,"" to facilitate his collection of evidence. Each OIA authorization lasted for ninety days and included a ""specific description of authorized otherwise illegal activity."" App'x at 1356-57. Pursuant to the OIA authorizations, ""under no circumstances"" could Barone ""initiate or instigate a plan or strategy to commit a federal, state or local offense."" Id. at 1358. And if he learned of such plans and did not report them ""immediately,"" he could be subject to ""full criminal prosecution."" Id.
In late 1999, Tony Piliero approached Barone about killing two individuals: ""Cliff"" and ""another individual in Connecticut with whom [Piliero] was angry."" App'x at 1323. Barone reported this encounter to his FBI handler, who in turn memorialized it in a Form 302. Id. Barone expressed doubt about Piliero's sincerity, but promised to alert his handler if Piliero contacted him again. Id.
Nine years passed. Then in 2008 an informant for the New York Police Department, Michael Cooks, told his handler about a murder plot involving Piliero and Barone. Sometime in the summer of 2008, Piliero and Barone had allegedly hatched a plot to murder one of Piliero's former employees, Douglas Agnessanto, on whom Piliero had taken out a life insurance policy. Barone asked Cooks to carry out the deed, and gave Cooks $1,000 and Agnessanto's personal information, including his address and Social Security number. Cooks proceeded to surveil Agnessanto's house.
In early January 2009, the FBI recorded a call that Cooks made to Barone. In it, Barone informed Cooks that Agnessanto's life insurance policy expired in February, and so the murder had to ""happen within the next week or two."" App'x at 886. Barone also assured Cooks that he was ready to pay him $50,000, provided Cooks perpetrated the crime ""the right way."" Id. at 1460. At a subsequent meeting on January 9, Barone reiterated that Agnessanto had to be murdered before February, and said that he would provide Cooks a gun with ""six shots."" Id. at 1490.
The FBI arrested Barone later that day. At the time of his arrest, Barone had not told his FBI handlers about the murder-for-hire plot. Id. at 876-77, 884.
II. Post-Arrest and Trial
After his arrest, Barone agreed to help the FBI build its case against Piliero. To provide cover for Barone, the FBI had him call a member of the Genovese crime family to say he had been arrested. Barone signed a form stating that he consented to making the call ""without threats or promises of any kind."" App'x at 1729.
Barone's identity as a cooperating witness nevertheless became public shortly after the complaint against Piliero was filed. The complaint, which was drafted by an AUSA and sworn out by Defendant Miceli, referred to Barone as ""CC-1."" Id. at 1818. The complaint further noted that CC-1 had been arrested on ""January 9, 2009 . . . outside his home in Westchester, New York."" Id. at 1819. Based on this information, a local newspaper identified Barone as the cooperating witness against Piliero. Concerned about Barone's safety following the revelation, the Federal Bureau of Prisons moved Barone out of the general population and into the Special Housing Unit (""SHU""). There, Barone was subject to ""administrative detention,"" ""a non-punitive status in which restricted conditions of confinement are required only to ensure the safety of inmates."" Id. at 94.
Barone and Piliero were tried before a jury in July 2010 for, inter alia, plotting murder for hire and conspiracy. The jury ultimately acquitted Barone and Piliero on the murder-for-hire charge, but failed to reach a verdict on the conspiracy charge. The District Court later entered a nolle prosequi on the conspiracy charge.
III. The Instant Litigation
Barone then brought the instant action. In his amended complaint against the United States and the agent Defendants, Barone alleged seven causes of action: FTCA claims for (1) malicious prosecution; (2) intentional and (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (4) prima facie tort and (5) negligence relating to Barone's detention in the SHU; (6) a Bivens claim for malicious prosecution; and (7) a Bivens due process claim relating to Barone's detention in the SHU. The District Court dismissed the claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress, prima facie tort, and negligence relating to Barone's detention in the SHU. The other four claims were allowed to proceed to discovery. The District Court later granted summary judgment to Defendants on the surviving claims.
Barone appeals the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Defendants on (1) the FTCA malicious prosecution claim; (2) the Bivens malicious prosecution claim; (3) the FTCA intentional infliction of emotional distress claim; and (4) the Bivens due process claim. He also appeals (5) the dismissal of the FTCA claim for negligence relating to his detention in the SHU.
DISCUSSION
We review the District Court's award of summary judgment de novo, ""constru[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the [losing party]"" and ""drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in [its] favor."" Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 22 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). We ""will affirm only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" In re 650 Fifth Ave. & Related Props., 830 F.3d 66, 86 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). To establish a genuine dispute, ""[t]he nonmoving party must set forth specific facts,"" and cannot rely on conclusory allegations. Rubens v. Mason, 527 F.3d 252, 254 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).
We also review de novo the District Court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 2009).
I. Malicious Prosecution Claims
Barone argues that, as a confidential informant, he was authorized by the FBI to engage in the murder-for-hire plot, thus negating probable cause for the prosecution. Barone's tale finds no support in the evidence. We thus conclude that the District Court was correct to grant summary judgment for Defendants on the malicious prosecution claims because there was no disputed issue of fact capable of negating the Defendants' showing of probable cause.
""The elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are: (1) the commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding by the defendant against the plaintiff, (2) the termination of the proceeding in favor of the accused, (3) the absence of probable cause for the criminal proceeding and (4) actual malice."" Torres v. Jones, 26 N.Y.3d 742, 760 (2016). ""Probable cause is defined as such facts and circumstances as would lead a reasonably prudent person in like circumstances to believe plaintiff guilty."" Perryman v. Vill. of Saranac Lake, 839 N.Y.S.2d 290, 292 (3d Dep't 2007).
Defendants undoubtedly had probable cause to prosecute Barone for the murder-for-hire plot. Between the summer of 2008, when he and Piliero first discussed the murder, and January 2009, when he was arrested, Barone engaged in a course of conduct evidencing a clear intent to have Agnessanto murdered. During this half-year period, Barone approached Cooks about the murder, paid Cooks $1,000 to surveil Agnessanto's house, planned the mechanics of the murder in macabre detail, pressured Cooks to complete the crime within weeks, and promised to pay Cooks $50,000 when the crime was complete. All the while, Barone provided the FBI with no information about the impending crime.
Yet Barone argues that the FBI gave all this its blessings. As evidence, he points to the murder-for-hire plot he reported in the January 2000 Form 302, which he asserts is somehow related to the murder for hire to be committed in January 2009. This claim is belied by the Form 302 itself, which was not only from nine years earlier, but makes no mention of a murder for insurance proceeds. Nor is his claim of authorization supported by the expired OIA authorization forms, which expressly prohibited him from ""initiat[ing] or instigat[ing] a plan or strategy to commit a federal, state or local offense,"" and required him to report crimes he learned of ""immediately."" App'x at 1358.
Simply put, there was no disputed issue of fact capable of negating the probable cause that justified the prosecution. Furthermore, the individual Defendants showed entitlement to have the claim of malicious prosecution dismissed by reason of their qualified immunity as their behavior did not violate any clearly established law at the time. We thus conclude that the District Court properly granted Defendants summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claims.
II. The Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Bivens Due Process, and Negligence Claims
Barone's FTCA intentional infliction of emotional distress and Bivens due process claims fare no better. According to Barone, agent Defendants recklessly or intentionally disclosed his identity as an FBI informant, thus placing him in physical danger. Specifically, Barone argues that the agent Defendants forced him to make the phone call to the member of the Genovese crime family, and the agent Defendants were responsible for the inclusion of identifying information in the complaint against Piliero. But Barone consented in writing to making the phone call, and the complaint was drafted by an AUSA, not the agent Defendants. The District Court thus properly granted summary judgment for Defendants on these claims.
Finally, we conclude that the District Court correctly held that Barone's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim falls within the discretionary-function exception for the FTCA. See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Barone on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the February 6, 2017 judgment of the District Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART, and that this case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Plaintiff-Appellant Mark Vaughn, proceeding pro se, appeals from a judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees. In 2009, Vaughn was ordered by the Kings County Supreme Court to participate in a drug rehabilitation program as an alternative to prison. He was assigned to Phoenix House of New York, Inc., where he was required to perform certain ""job functions."" App. 23. After earlier refusals to abide by this requirement, Vaughn eventually complied upon being informed by the Kings County Supreme Court in April 2011 that ""if [he was] kicked out of the program, [he would] go[] to jail."" App. 30. In May 2014, Vaughn sued Phoenix House and various of its employees and officers. He asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1994 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-19, as well as state and local laws. This appeal follows the district court's dismissal without prejudice of Vaughn's first amended complaint and its dismissal with prejudice of his second amended complaint. See Vaughn v. Phoenix House Programs of N.Y., No. 14 Civ. 3918, 2015 WL 5671902 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2015) (""Vaughn I""); Vaughn v. Phoenix House Programs of N.Y., No. 14 Civ. 3918, 2016 WL 4223748 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2016) (""Vaughn II""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor. Biro v. Condé Nast, 807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015). Because Vaughn appears pro se, we are ""constrained to conduct our examination with `special solicitude,' interpreting the complaint to raise the `strongest claims that it suggests.'"" Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir. 2006)).
Upon review, we conclude that Vaughn's claims under § 1983 are time barred. The only basis Vaughn asserts for state action is the role of the state court in gaining Vaughn's compliance with Phoenix House's rehabilitation program. Even assuming this would be sufficient to demonstrate state action, the most recent allegation of state intervention occurred in April 2011. Accordingly, any injury from the state action accrued in April 2011, more than three years before Vaughn filed his original complaint in May 2014. See Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 251 (1989) (recognizing three-year statute of limitations for § 1983 claims in New York).
We further conclude that Vaughn's claim under § 1994, the federal anti-peonage statute, lacks any merit. Vaughn alleged that he owed Phoenix House ""nothing in the way of finances or payment,"" Second Am. Compl. at 22, and he therefore cannot demonstrate that his circumstances qualify as peonage because he was not ""bound by the threat of a penal sanction to remain at his employment until [a] debt has been discharged."" Taylor v. Georgia, 315 U.S. 25, 29 (1942).
We believe, however, that Vaughn's FLSA claim needs further analysis. This claim was dismissed below on the grounds that Vaughn is not ""an `employee' protected by that statute"" because he received ""`the principal benefit of [his] participation in the [rehabilitation] program,'"" which he had entered ""`to resolve the criminal charges against him'"" rather than ""`for the purpose of receiving monetary compensation.'"" Vaughn II, 2016 WL 4223748, at *4 (quoting Vaughn I, 2015 WL 5671902, at *7-9). Yet in reaching this conclusion, neither the district court nor the authority on which it relies addressed an important precedent that may bear on this question.
In Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc., 811 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir. 2016), we addressed the question of ""under what circumstances an unpaid intern must be deemed an `employee' under the FLSA and therefore compensated for his work."" In doing so, we explained that ""the proper question is whether the intern or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the relationship"" and set out a non-exhaustive set of factors for courts to weigh as they consider ""the `economic reality' of the relationship."" Id. at 536-37 (quoting Barfield v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 537 F.3d 132, 141-42 (2d Cir. 2008)). Although that analysis was ""confined to internships"" and does not necessarily ""apply to training programs in other contexts"" in light of ""the relationship between the internship and the intern's formal education,"" id. at 537, the nature of that relationship may have some resemblance to the vocational training aspects of certain rehabilitation programs, a context in which other courts have looked to the purpose of the work performed because ""the presence of a rehabilitative element does not preclude an employment relationship,"" Williams v. Strickland, 87 F.3d 1064, 1067 (9th Cir. 1996). Nevertheless, Glatt was not addressed in Vaughn I or Vaughn II, nor in any of the briefing below or before this Court.
Rather than address in the first instance how Glatt may impact the resolution of this dispute, if at all, or whether disposing of this matter at the motion to dismiss stage is appropriate in light of Glatt and Williams, we deem it best to vacate the decision below with respect to its analysis of Vaughn's FLSA claim and to remand this matter for further consideration. This also necessitates vacating the dismissal of Vaughn's claims under state and city law, as they were dismissed solely based upon the district court's determination not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction following dismissal of Vaughn's federal claims. See Vaughn II, 2016 WL 4223748, at *5. Although we express no opinion on the merits of Vaughn's FLSA claim, we nevertheless find that its legal complexity is such that ""a claim of this sort is best made with the assistance of counsel"" and we therefore respectfully ""recommend that the district court, on remand, appoint counsel to aid [Vaughn] in pursing this claim."" Triestman, 470 F.3d at 476; see also 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1).
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court with respect to Vaughn's causes of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1994, we VACATE the judgment of the district court with respect to his causes of action under the FLSA, as well as his state and local claims, and we REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Plaintiffs-appellants Galvstar Holdings, LLC (""Galvstar"") and DSB Holdings, LLC appeal from an April 20, 2017 Order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing their suit against Defendants-appellees Harvard Steel Sales, LLC (""Harvard"") and Jeremy Jacobs, pursuant to a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).[2] Appellants argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing their claims because: (1) the district court misapplied the legal standards applicable to a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for their breach of joint venture, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims; and (2) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the appellants to amend their complaint. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. ""We review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting as true all factual claims in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Fink v. Time Warner Cable, 714 F.3d 739, 740-41 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam). ""To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id. ""A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
A joint venture is formed under New York law when:
(a) two or more persons enter into an agreement to carry on a venture for profit; (b) the agreement evinces their intent to be joint venturers; (c) each contributes property, financing, skill, knowledge, or effort; (d) each has some degree of joint control over the venture; and (e) provision is made for the sharing of both profits and losses.
SCS Commc'ns, Inc. v. Herrick Co., 360 F.3d 329, 341 (2d Cir. 2004). ""All of these elements must be present before joint venture liability may be imposed."" Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Atlanttrafik Express Serv. Ltd., 909 F.2d 698, 701 (2d Cir. 1990). As the district court concluded, Galvstar failed to adequately plead a breach of joint venture claim because: (1) it expressly disclaimed that it was forming a joint venture with Harvard in the February and May TPAs; and (2) no provision was made for the sharing of both profits and losses between Harvard and Galvstar.
The February and May TPAs between Galvstar and Harvard recite:
The relationship of Galvstar and Harvard under this Agreement shall be solely that of independent contractors. Nothing contained herein or any other documents comprising a part hereof shall be deemed to constitute or create a relationship of agency, joint venture, partnership or any relationship other than that as herein specified.
Joint App'x at 37. ""[T]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing,"" and this contractual statement is clear indication of an intent to not form a joint venture. Law Debenture Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. Maverick Tube Corp., 595 F.3d 458, 467 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted). Galvstar points out that the TPAs were between Harvard and Galvstar, LLC (which operated the steel plant), while the putative oral joint venture agreement was between Harvard and Galvstar Holdings, LLC (the holding company for Galvstar, LLC). However, the same individual—Daniel Bain, ""the principal of Galvstar Holdings, LLC""—provided the draft of the February TPA, signed the May TPA, and entered into the alleged oral joint venture agreement with Jacobs. It is implausible that Bain, Harvard, and Jacobs would expressly disclaim a joint venture in a written document, but then go ahead and create one in a side oral agreement.
Galvstar also argues that the TPA has no effect because the February TPA language predates the oral joint venture. But the May TPA came after the alleged oral agreement, and that agreement also disclaims any joint venture. Further, under New York law, all contemporaneous agreements between the same parties relating to the same subject matter are to be read together and interpreted as forming part of one and the same transaction. See Carvel Corp. v. Diversified Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 930 F.2d 228, 233 (2d Cir. 1991).
There are also no allegations plausibly demonstrating an agreement to share in the profits and losses of the alleged joint venture. ""An indispensable essential of a contract of partnership or joint venture, both under common law and statutory law, is a mutual promise or undertaking of the parties to share in the profits of the business and submit to the burden of making good the losses."" Dinaco, Inc. v. Time Warner, Inc., 346 F.3d 64, 68 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis in original); see also Steinbeck v. Gerosa, 4 N.Y.2d 302, 317 (1958). Galvstar's own pleadings make clear that the two parties agreed to keep their profits and losses separate. See, e.g., Pl. Compl. at ¶¶ 3, 4, 45. Therefore, we affirm the district court's dismissal of appellants' breach of joint venture claim.
2. Galvstar challenges the district court's ruling that it inadequately pled a breach of fiduciary duty claim by Harvard and Jacobs, individually. To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must plausibly allege facts demonstrating ""breach by a fiduciary of a duty owed to plaintiff; defendant's knowing participation in the breach; and damages."" SCS Commc'ns, 360 F.3d at 342. ""A fiduciary relationship exists under New York law when one [person] is under a duty to act for or to give advice for the benefit of another upon matters within the scope of the relation."" Flickinger v. Harold C. Brown & Co., 947 F.2d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted, alteration in original). ""Broadly stated, a fiduciary relationship is one founded upon trust or confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another. It is said that the relationship exists in all cases in which influence has been acquired and abused, in which confidence has been reposed and betrayed."" Penato v. George, 383 N.Y.S.2d 900, 904 (2d Dep't 1976). Fiduciary relationships in New York include ""those informal relations which exist whenever one man trusts in, and relies upon, another."" Id. at 904-05; see also EBC I, Inc. v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 5 N.Y.3d 11, 20 (2005) (""[I]t is fundamental that fiduciary `liability is not dependent solely upon an agreement or contractual relation between the fiduciary and the beneficiary but results from the relation.'"").
Nevertheless, absent an allegation of a special relationship, mere assertions of ""trust and confidence"" are insufficient to support a claim of a fiduciary relationship. See Freedman v. Pearlman, 706 N.Y.S.2d 405, 409 (1st Dep't 2000). Further, ""[w]hen parties deal at arm[`]s length in a commercial transaction, no relation of confidence or trust sufficient to find the existence of a fiduciary relationship will arise absent extraordinary circumstances."" In re Mid-Island Hosp., Inc., 276 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In sum, ""[a] fiduciary relationship is necessarily fact-specific and is also grounded in a higher level of trust than normally present in the marketplace between those involved in arm's length business transactions."" Oddo Asset Mgmt. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 19 N.Y.3d 584, 593 (2012) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). So unless the parties ""create their own relationship of higher trust, courts should not ordinarily transport them to the higher realm of relationship and fashion the stricter duty for them."" Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Since there was no joint venture formed between Harvard and Galvstar, any fiduciary duty that Harvard or Jacobs owed to Galvstar must be traced to another source. Appellants cite the intertwined relationship that Harvard had with Galvstar, but even construing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to apellants, the claim is not plausible. The allegations only demonstrate that Harvard had an arm's length purchaser-supplier relationship with Galvstar, and as such, Harvard had an interest in working with Galvstar to ensure that Galvstar produced the quality and quantity of steel in accordance with its needs. The parties' arm's length relationship is reinforced by the language of the TPAs, which disclaimed any formation of a formal or informal relationship between Harvard and Galvstar. Galvstar's allegations thus fail to establish the ""extraordinary circumstances"" needed to establish a fiduciary relationship between parties dealing at arm's length. See In re Mid-Island Hosp., Inc., 276 F.3d at 130.
Similarly, Galvstar fails to adequately plead any fiduciary duty that Jacobs, as President of Harvard, owed in his individual capacity to Galvstar; there are no specific allegations for why Jacobs owed a duty, other than the conclusory statement that he did. In any event, Galvstar's brief makes clear that Jacobs could not, by himself, make any decisions for Harvard, and there are no allegations that he acted in an individual capacity. Therefore, we affirm the district court's dismissal of appellants' breach of fiduciary duty claim.
3. Galvstar argues that the district court improperly found facts in dismissing the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. We agree.
""Under New York law, parties to an express contract are bound by an implied duty of good faith, but breach of that duty is merely a breach of the underlying contract."" Harris v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 310 F.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citation omitted). We will ""enforce the implied covenant where an implied promise was so interwoven in the whole writing of a contract as to be necessary for effectuation of the purposes of the contract,"" or ""where a party's acts subsequent to performance on the contract so directly destroy the value of the contract for another party that the acts may be presumed to be contrary to the intention of the parties[.]"" M/A-COM Sec. Corp. v. Galesi, 904 F.2d 134, 136 (2d Cir. 1990) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)(per curiam). ""[H]owever, the implied covenant does not extend so far as to undermine a party's general right to act on its own interests in a way that may incidentally lessen the other party's anticipated fruits from the contract."" Id. (internal citation and quotations marks omitted).
The breach of the implied covenant claimed by Galvstar is that Harvard participated in ""a scheme to take over Galvstar,"" and refused to pay overdue invoices in order to prevent Galvstar from enjoying the benefits of the May TPA, which is the operative agreement between the parties. Joint App'x at 28. The district court found that there are insufficient allegations to support a claim that Harvard participated in a scheme to take over Galvstar. However, taking all of Galvstar's allegations as true, the failure to pay invoices to Galvstar ""form[s] an essential link in the chain of events"" that deprived Galvstar of the benefits of the TPA, and eventually caused it to fail. M/A-COM Sec. Corp., 904 F.2d at 1337. ""Integral to a finding of a breach of the implied covenant is a party's action that directly violates an obligation that may be presumed to have been intended by the parties,"" and the TPA presumes that Harvard would pay invoices due to Galvstar. Id. at 136. The district court determined that Harvard's nonpayment was attributable to a dispute over the quality control of steel and a machine failure; but this was not pled by Galvstar, and such fact-finding outside of the allegations is not proper at the motion to dismiss stage. The district court's conclusion may hold true at the summary judgment stage; at this point, the court must take all nonconclusory allegations pled by Galvstar to be true.
Therefore, we vacate the dismissal of Galvstar's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
4. Galvstar seeks leave to amend its breach of contract claim, which the district court dismissed. ""We review the denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was based on an interpretation of law, in which case the legal conclusion is reviewed de novo."" Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 321 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted). Appellants did not seek leave to amend from the district court, as they were free to do, and we will not grant them leave to amend now. Cf. Gurary v. Nu-Tech Bio-Med, Inc., 303 F.3d 212, 225 (2d Cir. 2002) (""Unless manifest injustice will result from refusing to consider the newly raised issue, it is not properly before this panel.""). Galvstar contends that leave to amend was sought in the district court, but Galvstar's counsel merely stated that need to amend ""may"" arise at some point, and never sought leave to do so. Joint App'x at 124.
Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.
[1]  The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to amend the caption.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Robert L. Gordons LLC (""Gordons"") appeals from a June 8, 2017 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Furman, J.) granting U.S. Bank National Association's (""U.S. Bank"") motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Gordons argues on appeal that the district court failed to draw factual inferences in its favor and misconstrued New York State law. ""We review de novo a grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), `accepting the complaint's factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.'"" Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP, 854 F.3d 150, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Carpenters Pension Tr. Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC, 750 F.3d 227, 232 (2d Cir. 2014)). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
1. Background
The complaint alleges that in 2007, Washington Mutual Bank, F.A. loaned $368,000 to Sherry and Thomas Kim, neither of whom are parties to this case. The Kims secured their loan with a mortgage, which was properly recorded against their Manhattan condominium. Soung Ok Cho executed the loan on behalf of the Kims as attorney-in-fact pursuant to powers of attorney. The Kims later defaulted on both their mortgage payments and their payments to the condominium board. Bank of America, N.A., the loan assignee, began a foreclosure proceeding against the condominium in 2010, while the board acquired a lien against the condominium and auctioned it by sheriff's sale to Gordons. U.S. Bank, by then Bank of America's loan assignee, thereafter obtained a foreclosure judgment in state court. Beforethe state court entered the foreclosure judgment, Gordons commenced the instant litigation, seeking a declaratory judgment quieting title to the condominium. Gordons argued that the Kims' powers of attorney reflected defects that rendered them invalid under New York State General Obligations Law (GOL) § 5-1501. In Gordons's view, because the powers of attorney were invalid, the mortgage was invalid, which meant that U.S. Bank could not foreclose. The district court granted U.S. Bank's motion to dismiss, concluding that the powers of attorney were not invalid. Gordons filed a timely notice of appeal.
2. Discussion
Gordons raises three principal arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the Kims did not actually initial next to each power of attorney they delegated to Cho, as was required by New York State law when the powers of attorney were executed, see, e.g., In re Marriott, 86 A.D.3d 943, 944-45 (N.Y. App. Div. 4th Dep't 2011). The complaint alleges, without elaboration, that both Kims ""placed a mark, but not [their] initials"" next to the delegated powers. J.A. at 11, 16.
Although the district court did not address this allegation, we need not accept it as true. Gordons attached the powers of attorney to the original complaint, so we may look at the Kims' purported initials when assessing this allegation. See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). In our view, both documents appear to show both Kims' initials next to the powers at issue. Gordons has not made any further allegations that give us any reason to doubt this interpretation. The complaint does not, for example, allege that the marks were forged, or that the Kims purposefully declined to initial where requested. Having examined the powers of attorney attached to the complaint, we deem Gordons's conclusory allegation that these are not the Kims' initials to be implausible. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 681 (2009) (declining to credit ""bare assertions"").
Second, Gordons argues that various technical deficiencies in the powers of attorney render them invalid. These include typographical errors, such as using the word ""of"" where the statutory short form called for the word ""or,"" and formatting errors, such as the failure to put the words ""CAUTION"" and ""DIRECTIONS"" at the top of the powers of attorney in bold type-face. Gordons argues that, at the time the powers of attorney were executed, GOL § 5-1501(2) mandated the use of ""the exact wording"" and formatting set out in the statute, and that the Kims' powers of attorney are invalid because they depart from these standards. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that New York ""law did not provide that use of the statutory form was mandatory or that any form deviating from the requirements set forth in the statute would be invalid."" J.A. at 290.
We agree with the district court. Powers of attorney must strictly comply with GOL § 5-1501 to be considered statutory short form powers of attorney. But a power of attorney that fails to do so is not necessarily invalid; it is just not a statutory short form power of attorney. See § 5-1501(1) (""No provision of this article shall be construed to bar the use of any other or different form of power of attorney desired by the parties concerned.""); see also 2A N.Y. Jur. 2d Agency § 64 (""General powers of attorney are prescribed by statute so that, as a matter of public policy of the state, there can be a liberal use and judicial recognition of the efficacy of the powers of attorney. The statutory short-form power of attorney was prescribed to eliminate the technicalities inherent in the interpretation of words used to grant the authority under previous forms. However, the provision of a prescribed form does not bar the use or validity of any other or a different form of power of attorney desired by a person other than a principal."" (footnotes omitted)). Technical departures from the statutory short form requirements, therefore, did not invalidate the Kims' powers of attorney. See Kermanshahchi v. Republic Nat'l Bank of New York, S.A., No. 87 CIV. 2599 (JFK), 1991 WL 177282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 1991) (finding it dispositive that ""the parties intended the form . . . to serve as a valid and binding power of attorney"").
Gordons contends finally that the powers of attorney are invalid because they lacked certificates of conformity. GOL § 5-1501(1), at the time the powers of attorney were executed, required that such documents ""be duly acknowledged by the principal in the manner prescribed for the acknowledgement of a conveyance of real property."" New York Real Property Law (RPL) § 299-a(1) required that an acknowledgement or proof of a conveyance of real property, ""if taken in the manner prescribed by [a State other than New York], must be accompanied by a certificate that it conforms with such laws."" In Gordons's view, the Kims' powers of attorney are invalid because they were executed in New Jersey, not New York, and have no such certificate.
The district court did not expressly address this argument. Nonetheless, we find Gordons's position to be unpersuasive. RPL § 299-a requires a certificate of conformity only if the proof of the conveyance of real property is ""taken in the manner prescribed"" by a state other than New York. No such requirement exists if the acknowledgement is taken in the manner prescribed by New York. New York allows for the acknowledgment or proof to be taken before ""[a] notary public,"" in a state outside New York. RPL § 299. Both Kims executed their powers of attorney before a notary public in New Jersey, and the acknowledgements included with the powers of attorney substantially conform to New York's statutory form acknowledgment, see RPL § 309-b(1). Therefore, the Kims executed the powers of attorney in accordance with New York State law and did not require a certificate of conformity.

We have considered Gordons's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
ORDER OF GRIEVANCE PANEL
For the reasons that follow, the record of this disciplinary proceeding, except as to the portions described below, will be disclosed to the judge presiding over, and the parties to, the 28 U.S.C. § 2255 proceeding docketed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York under Bouchard v. United States, 12-cr-381 (N.D.N.Y.).
I. Overview of Disciplinary Record
By order filed in April 2016, this Court publicly reprimanded Gaspar Castillo for engaging in conduct unbecoming a member of the bar, and barred him from representing clients in this Court pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act for a two-year period. Castillo was represented in the disciplinary proceeding by Robert Roche.
The record for this disciplinary proceeding consists of a number of filings by Castillo and Roche and several orders of this panel, including (a) a May 2014 public order imposing an interim suspension; (b) a June 2014 public order terminating the interim suspension; (c) a June 2014 non-public order imposing a private reprimand; (d) an April 2016 public order imposing a public reprimand; and (e) a July 2016 public order imposing a reciprocal suspension, based on a suspension imposed by a state court. Until now, the only documents in the record available to the public have been the above-listed orders imposing public discipline.
Both Castillo and Roche filed documents in Castillo's disciplinary proceeding that reference medical information about themselves. That information is found in a May 2014 letter from Roche and a November 2015 affirmation from Castillo; both documents primarily address the allegations of misconduct in the disciplinary proceeding, although Roche's letter also addresses the timing of Castillo's response to the misconduct allegations.
II. The Present Request for Disclosure
Elizabeth Bouchard, on behalf of Michael Bouchard, recently requested that Castillo's disciplinary record be disclosed to her and Michael Bouchard for purposes of Mr. Bouchard's § 2255 proceeding, which commenced in October 2017. See Bouchard v. United States, 12-cr-381 (N.D.N.Y.), doc. 153 (§ 2255 motion, filed Oct. 17, 2017). Mr. Bouchard alleges in his § 2255 motion that, inter alia, he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Castillo, and that Castillo's disciplinary record in this Court is relevant to those claims. Id. at 48-88. In November 2017, this Court ordered Castillo and Roche to show cause why Castillo's disciplinary record should not be made public or, in the alternative, disclosed to Elizabeth and Michael Bouchard and/or the judge presiding over Mr. Bouchard's § 2255 proceeding. Castillo opposes disclosure; Roche has not responded.[1]
III. Disposition
Upon due consideration, it is hereby ORDERED that, with the exceptions noted below, the disciplinary record be provided to the judge and parties in Michael Bouchard's § 2255 proceeding. The exceptions are as follows:
(a) Roche's May 2014 letter will be redacted to delete several sentences on pages 1 and 2 concerning medical information relating to Roche (the first, third, fourth and fifth redactions), and two sentences and a portion of a sentence on page 1 concerning medical information relating to Castillo (the second redaction);
(b) Castillo's November 2015 affirmation will be redacted to delete a sentence on page 2 relating to a medical issue; and
(c) The documents concerning Bouchard's disclosure request will not be disclosed: the request itself, this Court's November 2017 order, and Castillo's opposition to the request, which concern only the present disclosure issue.[2]
Although Bouchard's criminal case was not at issue in Castillo's disciplinary proceeding, we conclude that the disciplinary record is arguably relevant to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in Bouchard's § 2255 proceeding. We further conclude that any interest Castillo and Roche may have in keeping the entire disciplinary record confidential is outweighed by Bouchard's interest in disclosure, particularly since: Castillo's disciplinary proceeding resulted in public discipline, much of the disciplinary record is already public, and redaction of specific sensitive information will protect Castillo's and Roche's privacy interests.
This Court does not have any rule or case law governing the disclosure of disciplinary records after an attorney disciplinary proceeding results in public discipline. However, the rules of other courts and disciplinary authorities support disclosure to varying degrees.
Only a few other circuits have published rules covering the issue. The relevant Third Circuit rule makes public, with certain exceptions, any disciplinary proceeding resulting in public discipline. See Third Circuit Rules of Attorney Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 15 (July 2015). The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits treat disciplinary records as confidential, with certain exceptions, but permit the chief judges of those circuits to make records public. See Sixth Circuit Rule 46(c)(2) (Aug. 2012); Eleventh Circuit Rules Governing Attorney Discipline, Rule 2(E) (Jan. 2002).[3]
The relevant statutes and rules of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont, governing disclosure of state disciplinary records, also would permit the disclosure of Castillo's disciplinary record.
Under New York law, state disciplinary records are initially confidential, but can be divulged upon a showing of good cause and, in any event, become public if ""charges are sustained by the justices of the appellate division."" N.Y. Judiciary Law § 90(10). Under Connecticut law, a disciplinary record is public, with certain exceptions that are not now relevant, if ""probable cause has been found that the attorney is guilty of misconduct."" Conn. Gen. Stats. § 2-50(c). Under Vermont law, in relevant part, all Professional Responsibility proceedings and records ""formally submitted to a hearing panel after the filing of formal charges or stipulation shall be public unless [an interested party] obtains . . . a protective order for specific testimony, documents, or records,"" except that ""the work product of the [Professional Responsibility] Board, hearing panel, and their counsel, as well as the deliberations of the hearing panel, Board, and Court shall remain confidential."" Vt. Supreme Ct. Admin. Order No. 9, Perm. Rules Governing Estab. & Operation of Prof'l Resp. Program, Rule 12(B).
Additionally, the American Bar Association's Model Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement provide that disciplinary proceedings become public, with certain exceptions, once there is a ""determination that probable cause exists to believe that misconduct occurred"" and formal charges have been filed and served. ABA, Model Rules for Lawyer Discipl. Enf., Rules 16(A) and (C) (Aug. 1989, amended Aug. 2002); id., Rules 16(D)-(E) (exceptions).
For present purposes, we need not determine whether all disciplinary records, or all disciplinary proceedings resulting in public discipline, are presumed to be open to the public. Nor do we decide that all references to medical information in a disciplinary record must be redacted when the record is disclosed. We hold only that, in this case, Bouchard has shown good cause for the disclosure of Castillo's record with certain redactions, and that the redacted portions contain personally sensitive information that is either irrelevant to Bouchard's § 2255 claims (e.g., Roche's medical information) or, at most, tangential to those claims (because the sensitive information relates to why certain defaults occurred, not whether they occurred).
 disciplinary record by this Court is barred absent his execution of a release pursuant to the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA""). First, this Court is not one of the entities covered by that statute. See 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-1(a) (stating that the statute applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers); Executive Order No. 13181, Dec. 20, 2000, 65 F.R. 81321 (""HIPAA applies only to `covered entities,' such as health care plans, providers, and clearinghouses. HIPAA regulations therefore do not apply to other organizations and individuals that gain access to protected health information, including Federal officials who gain access to health records during health oversight activities.""); 45 C.F.R. § 160.103 (""Covered entity means: (1) A health plan. (2) A health care clearinghouse. (3) A health care provider who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction covered by this subchapter."").
Second, and in any event, the redactions required by this order will avoid any unauthorized or inappropriate disclosure of medical information.
[1]  For present purposes, we do not deem Roche's failure to respond to be a waiver of the disclosure issue, and assume that he opposes disclosure of the medical-related information concerning him.
[2]  The Court's deliberative documents, such as memoranda prepared in-chambers or by counsel to the Grievance Panel that were not intended for filing, are not part of the disciplinary record and are not subject to disclosure.
[3]  The Sixth Circuit's Rule 46(c)(2) provides that ""[a]ll records pertaining to disciplinary proceedings before the court must be filed under seal, unless the chief judge orders otherwise."" The Eleventh Circuit's Rule 2(E) provides that ""[e]xcept as provided in Rule 13(C) [permitting public discipline orders to be transmitted to other disciplinary authorities], unless and until otherwise ordered by the Chief Judge, all reports, records of proceedings, and other materials presented by the Court, the [Court's] Committee [on Lawyer Qualifications and Conduct], or any person to the Clerk of the Court (the Clerk) for filing shall be filed and maintained as sealed and confidential documents and shall be labeled accordingly by the Court, the Committee, or the person presenting such matters for filing.""

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant Arthur Freer, proceeding pro se, seeks review of a final determination by the Commissioner of Social Security (""Commissioner"") denying his application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. He appeals from the magistrate judge's grant of judgment on the pleadings to the Commissioner. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review de novo a judgment on the pleadings. Zabala v. Astrue, 595 F.3d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 2010). When the judgment upholds a benefits determination by the Commissioner, we assess ""whether there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner's decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard."" Id. (quoting Machadio v. Apfel, 276 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir. 2002)). ""The substantial evidence standard means that once an [administrative law judge (""ALJ"")] finds facts, we can reject those facts only if a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude otherwise."" Brault v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 683 F.3d 443, 448 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Upon such review, we find that the ALJ applied the correct legal standards, and that the determination that Freer was not disabled was supported by substantial evidence. As part of the test set out in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520, 416.920, the ALJ found that Freer:
1) had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since becoming disabled;
2) was not mentally deficient but did suffer from physical impairments, some severe (such as degenerative changes of the right shoulder and spine and osteoarthritis of the knee), others not (including carpal tunnel syndrome);
3) did not have any impairments equivalent in severity to those listed in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1;
4) could perform sedentary work but not his past, more physical work; and
5) could work as an information clerk or a call-in operator, both unskilled jobs for which the national economy has a reasonably strong demand.
Freer argues on appeal that the pain from his injuries and the side effects from his medication preclude him from performing even sedentary work. But the ALJ considered both issues, finding that Freer's objective medical records and relatively active life suggested that Freer's allegations about his subjective pain and side effects were overstated. Freer has not provided us any reason to believe that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude otherwise.[1] Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the same reasons as the magistrate judge stated in her March 31, 2017 order.
We have considered all of Freer's arguments and find them to be without merit.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment.
[*]   Judge Edward Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.
[1]  Freer also says that he will need more surgeries in the future, but such potential future impairments have no bearing on whether the ALJ erred in finding that he was not disabled from 2009 through 2013. See Polynice v. Colvin, 576 F. App'x 28, 31 (2d Cir. 2014) (""The finding that [a plaintiff] was disabled more than two and a half years after the ALJ's unfavorable decision says little about `whether plaintiff was disabled' during the time period relevant here, `and any inference that can be drawn is too weak to displace the substantial evidence supporting the ALJ's determination.'""

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the orders entered on September 17, 2015, and February 17, 2017, are AFFIRMED.
Intervenor Panikos Symeou appeals from denials of his motions (1) to vacate an ex parte order authorizing Appellee Hornbeam Corporation (""Hornbeam"") to compel document discovery from banks and other entities within the Southern District of New York for use in an anticipated action in the British Virgin Islands (""BVI"") against Halliwel Assets Inc. (""Halliwel"") and its related persons and entities, see 28 U.S.C. § 1782; and (2) for relief from that order, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
A district court is authorized to grant a § 1782 application if (1) ""the person from whom discovery is sought resides (or is found)"" within the court's district, (2) ""the discovery is for use in a foreign proceeding before a foreign tribunal,"" and (3) ""the application is made by a[n] . . . interested person."" Brandi-Dohrn v. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, 673 F.3d 76, 80 (2d Cir. 2012). If the statutory requirements are met, the court is free to grant discovery, and we will review its decision only for abuse of discretion. See id.
Symeou argues that the district court erred in concluding that the second requirement was satisfied because no foreign proceeding was then pending or contemplated. Precedent does not demand that the foreign proceeding be ""pending"" or ""imminent""; rather, a § 1782 applicant ""must present to the district court some concrete basis from which it can determine that the contemplated proceeding is more than just a twinkle in counsel's eye."" Certain Funds, Accounts and/or Inv. Vehicles v. KPMG, L.L.P., 798 F.3d 113, 123-24 (2d Cir. 2015).
The district court concluded that a foreign proceeding was within reasonable contemplation at the time of Hornbeam's § 1782 application, and we agree. As the district court observed in its December 24, 2014 authorization order, Hornbeam previously brought two related actions in the BVI against Halliwel and represented that it intended to initiate further litigation once it obtained additional information. This provides a sufficiently ""concrete basis"" for a ""contemplated [foreign] proceeding."" Id. at 124.
In urging otherwise, Symeou observes that Hornbeam was subject to an $846,526 judgment in the BVI as a result of the prior actions and that Hornbeam could not proceed on any new claims in the BVI until it satisfied that judgment. Neither the outstanding judgment, nor Hornbeam's delay in satisfying it, however, brings a foreign proceeding outside of reasonable contemplation, particularly where Hornbeam stated its intent to return to the BVI, articulated a theory on which it intended to litigate, and had the financial ability to pay the judgment. See In re Application of Bracha Found., 663 F. App'x 755, 763-64 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding foreign proceeding ""within reasonable contemplation"" for purposes of Hornbeam's § 1782 application in Northern District of Alabama).[1]
Symeou further relies on the fact that Vadim Shulman—the individual for whom Hornbeam holds in trust shares of Halliwel common stock—subsequently brought suit in England to argue that Hornbeam did not, in fact, contemplate further proceedings in the BVI. That fact is not properly considered on appeal, however, because we must ""assess the indicia of whether the contemplated proceedings were within reasonable contemplation at the time the § 1782 application was filed."" Certain Funds, Accounts and/or Inv. Vehicles v. KPMG, L.L.P., 798 F.3d at 124 (emphasis added) (considering ""the facts as they were presented to the district court"" and declining to consider import of later-filed action). Accordingly, we identify no error in the district court's determination that Hornbeam satisfied the § 1782 statutory requirements.
A district court's discretion under § 1782 ""must be exercised in light of the twin aims of the statute: providing efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation in our federal courts and encouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar means of assistance to our courts."" Mees v. Buiter, 793 F.3d 291, 297-98 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has identified certain factors as relevant to a § 1782 ruling, two of which are disputed here: (1) the ""receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance,"" and (2) whether the discovery request ""conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country."" Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 264-65 (2004). Symeou argues that Hornbeam's obligation to satisfy the outstanding BVI judgment before commencing another suit there provides ""a clear statement that BVI courts would not receive any evidence from the United States."" Intervenor Br. at 46. We are not persuaded because the BVI judgment only imposed a filing prerequisite and does not speak to the foreign jurisdiction's receptiveness to the specific discovery sought in Hornbeam's § 1782 application. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court—once authorized—did not abuse its discretion in granting discovery under § 1782.
Symeou contends that, even if § 1782 discovery was properly granted, the district court nonetheless erred in denying his motions to vacate and to reconsider. These challenges are meritless.
Although Symeou argues that the district court improperly granted Hornbeam's § 1782 application ex parte, this court has decided appeals from motions to quash ex parte § 1782 subpoenas without identifying any impropriety in the ex parte nature of the § 1782 application. See Brandi-Dohrn v. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, 673 F.3d at 78, 84; Nat'l Broad. Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co., 165 F.3d 184, 186-91 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Gushlak v. Gushlak, 486 F. App'x 215, 217 (2d Cir. 2012) (""[I]t is neither uncommon nor improper for district courts to grant applications made pursuant to § 1782 ex parte.""). In any event, Symeou has identified no prejudice stemming from the ex parte nature of the proceedings. The district court permitted Symeou to intervene, considered Symeou's motion to vacate the § 1782 discovery order, and entered a protective order governing the materials Hornbeam obtained as a result of that order.
As for the district court's refusal to sanction Hornbeam by vacating the § 1782 authorization order and quashing any ensuing subpoenas, we review only for abuse of discretion, and identify no such abuse here. See Southern New Eng. Tel. Co. v. Glob. NAPs Inc., 624 F.3d 123, 143 (2d Cir. 2010) (sanctions); In re Fitch, Inc., 330 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir. 2003) (motion to quash); see also Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2010) (""A court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous factual finding or [when] its decision—though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding—cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).
Symeou sought sanctions against Hornbeam on two grounds: (1) its failure to disclose certain information in its ex parte § 1782 application, and (2) its failure to provide prior notice of subpoenas issued under the § 1782 authorization order, in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(4). In rejecting the first argument, the district court concluded that, even assuming an ethical violation occurred, the court would not vacate its § 1782 order as a sanction because the newly presented facts did not alter its initial discovery ruling. Such a decision was well within the district court's discretion. As for the notice failure, the district court found Hornbeam not to have complied with Rule 45(a)(4). See 28 U.S.C. § 1782(a) (stating that, unless authorization order provides otherwise, subpoenaed documents shall be produced in accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(4) (requiring that notice and copy of subpoena commanding production of documents must be served on each party before it is served on person to whom it is directed). Nevertheless, it declined to vacate or quash, finding that Symeou did not establish prejudice from the lack of notice. Instead, the district court directed Hornbeam to provide Symeou with copies of all previously issued subpoenas and to allow Symeou to inspect all materials produced in response. Having reviewed the record, we identify no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court.
Finally, Symeou argues that the district court improperly afforded Hornbeam overbroad discovery and failed to direct Hornbeam to destroy unrelated records containing confidential information. ""A district court has broad latitude to determine the scope of discovery and to manage the discovery process."" EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695 F.3d 201, 207 (2d Cir. 2012). The record shows that the district court carefully considered Hornbeam's discovery request and gave proper attention to its scope, narrowing the range of documents initially sought in the § 1782 application and later entering a protective order covering certain responsive materials. We conclude that the district court's discovery orders and these subsequent actions manifest no abuse of discretion.
We have considered Symeou's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the reasons stated, the district court's orders are AFFIRMED.
[1]  The BVI Commercial Court imposed the judgment on December 10, 2014. Hornbeam filed its ex parte § 1782 application in the Southern District of New York on December 19, 2014. Due to ""highly contested proceedings"" in the BVI, Hornbeam did not pay the full amount of the judgment against it until November 14, 2016.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the amended judgment entered on January 6, 2017, is AFFIRMED.
Defendant Moses Stern appeals from an award of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs Amusement Industry, Inc. d/b/a Westland Industries and Practical Finance Co., Inc. (collectively, ""Amusement"") on their state-law claims of fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and conspiracy arising from a real estate transaction in which Stern obtained $13 million from Amusement in connection with the purchase of a portfolio of retail shopping centers. We review an award of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in that party's favor. See Townsend v. Benjamin Enters., Inc., 679 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2012). We ""may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record."" Bruh v. Bessemer Venture Partners III L.P., 464 F.3d 202, 205 (2d Cir. 2006). In applying these principles here, we assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
Stern challenges the district court's drawing of adverse inferences from deposition invocations of the Fifth Amendment privilege by Stern and third-party defendant Stephen Friedman. Stern failed to raise this argument as to his own invocation in objecting to Magistrate Judge Gorenstein's August 11, 2016 report and recommendation. See Cephas v. Nash, 328 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2003) (stating general rule that failure to object to purported error in magistrate judge's report waives further judicial review of point). Even were we to excuse such waiver, see id., however, Stern's invocation challenges do not warrant vacatur.
While adverse inferences cannot be drawn against a non-moving party at summary judgment based on an invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege, see In re 650 Fifth Ave. & Related Props., 830 F.3d 66, 93 n.25 (2d Cir. 2016), ""invocation of the Fifth Amendment is not a substitute for relevant evidence"" and does not free a litigant ""from adducing proof in support of a burden which would otherwise have been his,"" United States v. Certain Real Prop. & Premises Known as 4003-4005 5th Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y., 55 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, this court has affirmed an award of summary judgment despite the district court's assumption that adverse inferences could be drawn from deposition invocations of the Fifth Amendment because ""the lack of testimony from those witnesses meant that there was no record evidence to dispute the overwhelming evidence"" proffered by the moving party. In re 650 Fifth Ave. & Related Props., 830 F.3d at 93 n.25. That is this case.
Our independent review of the record reveals that, for substantially the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation and adopted by the district court, Amusement proffered sufficient evidence to establish the elements of its claims, with Stern adducing no admissible evidence creating any triable issue of fact. See Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Stern, No. 07 Civ. 11586 (LAK) (GWG), 2016 WL 4249965, at *8-15 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2016), adopted by 2016 WL 6820744 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2016). We further note that the district court concluded that evidence showing Amusement's reliance on Stern's misrepresentations ""alone [was] sufficient"" to support its summary judgment award, that such evidence was merely ""buttressed by Stern's invocation of the Fifth Amendment,"" and that Friedman's invocation of the Fifth Amendment was no more than ""icing on the cake."" Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Stern, No. 07 Civ. 11586 (LAK) (GWG), 2016 WL 6820744, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2016). Thus, to the extent Stern argues the district court granted summary judgment ""solely based upon"" adverse inferences drawn from the Fifth Amendment invocations, Appellant's Br. at 17, he mischaracterizes the district court's decision.
In urging otherwise, Stern points to a 2009 bankruptcy decision denying Amusement a preliminary injunction preventing First Republic Group Realty, LLC from utilizing disputed funds. See Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Citigroup Global Mkts. Realty Corp. (In re First Republic Grp. Realty, LLC), 421 B.R. 659 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2009). He argues that the decision ""paint[s] a much different picture"" of the facts in this case, Appellant's Br. at 4, and, in particular, sheds light on the relationships among the various parties involved in the real estate transaction. The argument fails because Stern offers no explanation as to how the bankruptcy court's preliminary factual findings, made years earlier and on a different record, here raise genuine issues of material fact. He does not argue, nor could he, that the requirements of issue preclusion are met as to any disputed issue. See Proctor v. LeClaire, 715 F.3d 402, 414 (2d Cir. 2013). Nor does Stern dispute that he subsequently pleaded guilty to having committed perjury in the bankruptcy proceedings. Insofar as Stern relies on the bankruptcy court decision to argue that Amusement's witnesses are generally not credible, such conclusory attacks are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Island Software & Computer Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 413 F.3d 257, 261 (2d Cir. 2005) (recognizing that ""[b]road, conclusory attacks on the credibility of a witness will not, by themselves, present questions of material fact"").[1]
Stern further argues that plaintiffs cannot prove his ""intent to defraud Amusement,"" Appellant's Br. at 18 (emphasis in original), by relying on statements ""made to third-parties"" and ""not directly to"" plaintiffs, Reply Br. at 9 (citing Pasternack v. Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings, 27 N.Y.3d 817, 37 N.Y.S.3d 750 (2016)). While Pasternack holds that the reliance element of a fraud claim cannot be proved by reference to a defendant's misrepresentation to a third party, see 27 N.Y.3d at 828-29, 37 N.Y.S.3d at 750, the New York Court of Appeals there explicitly distinguished cases in which ""the third party acted as a conduit to relay the false statement to plaintiff, who then relied on the misrepresentation to his detriment,"" id. (stating that indirect communication can establish fraud claim, so long as statement was made with intent that it be communicated to plaintiff and that plaintiff rely on it). To the extent plaintiffs' claim is premised on indirect communications, they assert, with record support, that Stern made misrepresentations with intent that they be conveyed to and relied on by Amusement. Accordingly, Pasternack affords Stern no relief from the challenged judgment.
Stern nevertheless argues that Amusement cannot show reasonable reliance because its principal, Allen Alevy, testified at his deposition that he understood Friedman to be Amusement's attorney, thereby precluding reasonable belief that Friedman was making representations on behalf of Stern. But Alevy also testified that he understood Friedman to be acting as Stern's attorney. Indeed, record evidence establishes that Friedman served as Stern's ""general coun[se]l in this transaction"" and that Stern held him out as such. App'x 500. Accordingly, the cited Alevy testimony raises no genuine issue of material fact as to the reasonableness of Amusement's reliance.
Finally, Stern's assertion that plaintiffs have already recovered $26 million from other parties for the injuries at issue is based only on a confidential settlement to which Stern lacks access. Because Stern adduces no evidence to support this assertion, it cannot raise a question of fact to defeat summary judgment. See Davis v. New York, 316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002) (recognizing that ""reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion""). Nor does Stern cite any authority supporting his proposition that such a recovery creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to causation.[2]
In sum, the record demonstrates that Amusement is entitled to summary judgment on its fraud, unjust enrichment, conversion, and conspiracy claims. We have considered Stern's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the award of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs is AFFIRMED.
[1]  The same conclusion obtains with regard to Stern's contention that the other opinion he submitted to the district court—an unpublished 2007 California state court decision affirming a judgment against Amusement arising out of an unrelated real estate transaction, see Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Antin, No. B181465, 2007 WL 1241548 (Cal. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2007)—shows ""[t]his is clearly not the first time"" Amusement has ""engaged in such a scheme,"" Appellant's Br. at 12-13.
[2]  Stern also summarily asserts that plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on the conversion claim because ""[a]s [Bankruptcy] Judge Glenn found, Amusement ratified the transaction, and proceeded as if it owned the malls"" and, thus, ""Amusement cannot now claim that Stern is exercising unauthorized dominion or control over its property."" Appellant's Br. at 20. We have determined that findings of the bankruptcy court do not here establish triable issues of fact, and Stern points to no record evidence in support of this contention.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellants appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Torres, J.), which affirmed the order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Chapman, J.) sustaining the omnibus objections filed by the Trustee appointed for the liquidation of Lehman Brothers Inc. (""LBI""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Appellants, former employees of LBI, received part of their compensation in cash and part in equity in the form of restricted stock units (""RSUs""). The RSUs converted into common stock in LBI's parent company, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (""LBHI""), after a five-year holding period, subject to the satisfaction of certain employment-related conditions. When LBI entered into liquidation pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, 15 U.S.C. § 78aaa et seq. (""SIPA""), many employees held RSUs for which the holding period had not yet elapsed; LBI also owed RSUs that had not yet been granted to certain commission-based employees. Appellants now seek cash payments from LBI as creditors for the amounts in RSUs they held (the ""Equity Award Claims"") and for the amounts in RSUs that LBI owed them on the bankruptcy filing date (the ""Accrued Equity Claims"").
A district court has appellate jurisdiction over a bankruptcy court decision. See 28 U.S.C. § 158(a). ""Review of an order of a district court issued in its capacity as an appellate court is plenary."" In re DeTrano, 326 F.3d 319, 321 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). ""[W]e review the bankruptcy court decision independently, accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous but reviewing its conclusions of law de novo."" Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:
For the purpose of distribution under this title, a claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor, [or] damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security, . . . shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security, except that if such security is common stock, such claim has the same priority as common stock.
11 U.S.C. § 510(b). Section 510(b) thus implements the absolute priority rule, which gives creditors priority over shareholders in the event of liquidation. See In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., 855 F.3d 459, 470 (2d Cir. 2017) (""In re LBHI"").
LBHI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and LBI was ordered into liquidation pursuant to SIPA on September 19, 2008. In the separate LBHI proceeding, certain former employees (some of whom are claimants in this appeal) filed proofs of claim seeking recovery in the form of cash payments for compensation that had been paid them in RSUs. We held in that appeal that the claimants' RSU-based claims should be subordinated to the claims of general creditors because, pursuant to Section 510(b), RSUs are securities, the claimants acquired them in a purchase, and the claims based on ownership of the RSUs are for damages arising from that purchase. In re LBHI, 855 F.3d at 465. Here, the Appellants' Equity Award Claims are identical to the claims asserted in the LBHI proceeding for cash payments based on the ownership of RSUs. In re LBHI is therefore dispositive regarding the application of Section 510(b) to the Equity Award Claims, which we conclude are subject to mandatory subordination to the claims of general creditors.
Appellants argue that the Accrued Equity Claims, which are not based on RSUs but rather the right to receive RSUs, are distinguishable and should not be subordinated because the RSUs were not granted at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Section 510(b) requires subordination if a claimant ""took on the risk and return expectations of a shareholder, rather than a creditor."" Rombro v. Dufrayne (In re Med Diversified, Inc.), 461 F.3d 251, 256 (2d Cir. 2006). This policy rationale applies ""even if there is no actual sale or purchase because even before they receive any stock or extend a line of credit, investors and creditors have different expectations."" Id. at 258 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration omitted). Accordingly, subordination under Section 510(b) likewise extends to claims for the failure to issue securities if the claimant took on the risks and rewards of an equity investor. Id.; see also In re MF Global Holdings, Ltd., No. 11-15059 (MG), 2014 WL 3882363, *5-6 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 2014) (holding that Section 510(b) extends to a claim for a bonus that would have been paid in RSUs), In re Enron Corp., 341 B.R. 141, 162-63 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding that claims alleging the failure to deliver purchased ""phantom"" stock should be subordinated pursuant to Section 510(b)).
The bankruptcy court found in the LBHI proceeding that ""at all relevant times, the RSU Claimants understood that they would be compensated both with cash and with rights to become holders of LBHI common stock. They had a bargaining position and a choice as to whether or not to accept and continue employment at Lehman."" In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., 519 B.R. 47, 61 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2014).[1] Accordingly, we held in In re LBHI that the claimants took on the risk and return expectations of a shareholder by agreeing to be paid a portion of their compensation in the form of RSUs, a type of security that is tied to the value of the company's common stock. 855 F.3d at 481. The fact that certain commission-based employees in the instant LBI proceeding had not yet received the RSUs to which they were entitled when LBI filed for bankruptcy is legally insignificant: the record shows that the Appellants ""bargained not for cash but to become a stockholder"" and that they therefore ""became bound by the choice [they] made to trade the relative safety of cash compensation for the upside potential of shareholder status."" In re Med Diversified, Inc., 461 F.3d at 256. Because the Appellants assumed the reward and risk expectations of shareholders when they agreed to receive compensation in the form of RSUs, the Accrued Equity Claims must also be subordinated.
Finally, Appellants argue that they have a claim for cash against LBI because LBI did not properly novate or assign its RSU-based compensation obligations to LBHI. But the RSU-program documents evidence that the Appellants never had a right to cash compensation in lieu of the RSUs: ""With respect to any [RSUs] granted under the Plan, the obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary are limited solely to the delivery of shares of Common Stock . . . and in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation . . ."" See App'x 512 § 8(b)). An argument that claims for cash for issued RSUs are exempt from Section 510(b) was expressly rejected in In re LBHI: ""[W]e conclude that the claimants cannot assert claims arising from anything other than the purchase of RSUs because they have already been paid the compensation they were due in the form of RSUs and, as a result, have no right to any other mode of performance."" 855 F.3d at 479. Similarly, here, Appellants have rights only to the delivery of LBHI stock after the five-year holding period and the satisfaction of certain employment-related conditions. Accordingly, the contract-based novation and assignment arguments that Appellants assert do not allow them to avoid subordination of their claims pursuant to Section 510(b).
We have considered Appellants' remaining arguments and conclude that they are without any merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
[1]  During a legal sufficiency hearing for Appellants' claims, Judge Chapman held that her LBHI decision also applies to the instant LBI proceeding with respect to claims for RSUs and the failure to issue RSUs. App'x 273-74 (65:25-66:4).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the sentence of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Respondent-appellant James Ross Mellon, II appeals from an order of the district court enforcing an Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") administrative summons concerning alleged non-payment of taxes from 2005 through 2011. Mellon argues on appeal that: (1) the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him; (2) the administrative summons is not enforceable under United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964), because it was not served in good faith; and (3) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the administrative summons. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. A district court has personal jurisdiction over ""any person [who] is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data"" so long as: (1) the person summoned ""resides or is found"" in that court's district; and (2) the summons was served ""by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, records, or other data."" I.R.C. § 7604(a). Mellon first argues that service of the show cause order and petition to enforce the summons was improper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e), which requires that an individual be served at their ""dwelling or usual place of abode."" Id. Mellon contends that his Fifth Avenue apartment, where he was served, is not his dwelling or usual place of abode, and that he lives in Klosters, Switzerland. Mellon also argues that the improper exercise of personal jurisdiction by the district court violated due process.
We ""review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code de novo."" Adamowicz v. United States, 531 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citation omitted). The same standards apply to our review of the district court's ruling on subject matter and personal jurisdiction. See In re Petition of Germain, 824 F.3d 258, 261 (2d Cir. 2016) (subject matter jurisdiction); Marvel Characters, Inc. v. Kirby, 726 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2013) (personal jurisdiction).
Based on the record in the district court, we cannot say the court committed clear error in finding that service on Mellon was proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e), thereby giving the district court personal jurisdiction over him to enforce the summons. ""[I]n a highly mobile and affluent society, it is unrealistic to interpret [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4] so that the person to be served has only one dwelling house or usual place of abode at which process may be left."" Nat'l Dev. Co. v. Triad Holding Corp., 930 F.2d 253, 257 (2d Cir. 1991)(internal citation omitted). A wooden reading of the rule would ignore its purpose: to insure that service is reasonably calculated to provide a defendant with actual notice of the action. See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950) (due process requires that ""notice [be] reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,"" to provide parties with notice of pending action). Accordingly, ""a person can have two or more `dwelling houses or usual places of abode,' provided each contains sufficient indicia of permanence."" Nat'l Dev. Co., 930 F.2d at 257. Such indicia give confidence that the person served will receive notice.
The affidavit from the IRS Agent investigating Mellon, on which the district court relied, documented sufficient indicia of permanence to demonstrate that Mellon's dwelling or usual place of abode was his Fifth Avenue apartment: Mellon has owned the apartment for many years; he listed the Fifth Avenue address as his residence on a power of attorney form and a bank account agreement; he has responded to mail sent by the IRS to the Fifth Avenue address; Mellon has made public representations about residing in the Fifth Avenue apartment; his wife resides in the apartment; and the doorman at the apartment represented that Mellon resides in the apartment. And Mellon does not deny that he stays in that apartment when in New York. Mellon countered with declarations from his brother-in-law and a travel agent which state that he primarily lives in Europe. These declarations do not demonstrate that the district court committed clear error. See Norris v. Causey, 869 F.3d 360, 368 (5th Cir. 2017) (upholding service at a home in New Mexico where the defendant's wife lived, although the defendant argued that he had permanently relocated to Denver five years prior); Nat'l Dev. Co., 930 F.2d at 257 (upholding service on the defendant at his U.S. apartment despite his having twelve other residences around the world and spending a minority of his time in U.S.); Karlsson v. Rabinowitz, 318 F.2d 666, 667-9 (4th Cir.1963) (upholding service on the defendant's wife at the defendant's former house, even though the defendant had permanently relocated to another state); Dunn v. Burns, 839 N.Y.S.2d 894, 896 (4th Dep't 2007) (finding that service on the defendant's common law wife in the U.S. was proper even though the defendant worked in the United Arab Emirates and argued that he had moved there permanently). Further, because service was proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e), so that Mellon received actual notice, there is no due process violation. Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314.[1]
Lastly, the district court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine Mellon's dwelling or usual place of abode. Mellon had every opportunity to introduce further evidence supporting his argument to the district court, chose not to, and did not request an evidentiary hearing on this matter. See United States v. Noall, 587 F.2d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1978) (hearing not necessary where taxpayer ""could have proffered appropriate affidavits""). We will not remand to correct his omissions.
2. Mellon next argues that service of the administrative summons was not in accordance with I.R.C. § 7603(a) because he was not served at his ""last and usual place of abode,"" as required by that provision, and that the government cannot demonstrate ""good faith in issuing the summons."" United States v. Clarke, 134 S. Ct. 2361, 2365 (2014). An individual must comply with an IRS summons as ""long as the summons meets statutory requirements and is issued in good faith[.]"" United States v. Stuart, 489 U.S. 353, 356 (1989). For ""good faith,"" the government must make a prima facie showing as to the four factors listed in United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964). Clarke, 134 S. Ct. at 2365. The four Powell factors are: (1) the IRS' investigation is conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose; (2) the summons is relevant to that purpose; (3) the information sought is not already within the Commissioner's possession; and (4)the administrative steps required by the Code have been followed. Powell, 379 U.S. at 57-58. ""[T]he IRS usually files an affidavit from the responsible investigating agent."" Clarke 134 S. Ct. at 2365. The Supreme Court ""long ago held that courts may ask only whether the IRS issued a summons in good faith, and must eschew any broader role of `oversee[ing] the [IRS's] determinations to investigate.'"" Id. at 2367 (internal citation omitted).
Once the government sustains its ""minimal"" burden of compliance with the Powell factors, ""the burden shifts to the taxpayer to disprove one of the four Powell criteria, or to demonstrate that judicial enforcement would be an abuse of the court's process."" Adamowicz, 531 F.3d at 156 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). ""The taxpayer bears a heavy burden in this regard, because he or she must disprove the actual existence of a valid civil tax determination or collection purpose by the IRS."" Id. Mellon's arguments fail for three reasons.
First, this argument was not made below before the district court, so Mellon forfeited any right to bring it before this court. See Greene v. United States, 13 F.3d 577, 586 (2d Cir.1994)(""[I]t is a well-established general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal."").
Second, if we exercised discretion to hear this forfeited argument, Mellon cannot support the heavy burden of proving that his Fifth Avenue apartment is not his ""last and usual place of abode."" The district court relied on two affidavits from the investigating IRS Agent, as well as supporting documents and Mr. Mellon's own statements. While Mellon argues that, at a minimum, he deserved an evidentiary hearing, as stated prior, one was not required, he did not request one, and we will not remand for a hearing where Mellon had every opportunity to proffer evidence already. See Noall, 587 F.2d at 127.
Third, even if the summons was not served at Mellon's ""last and usual place of abode"" in accordance with I.R.C. § 7603(a), ""violations of the IRC or tax regulations occurring in the course of a tax investigation do not necessarily require related tax summonses to be quashed."" Adamowicz, 531 F.3d at 161. We look at the totality of the circumstances, and will conclude the issuance of a summons violated Powell only if the taxpayer can show ""they have been harmed or prejudiced by the alleged errors."" Id. at 162; see also United States v. Richey, 632 F.3d 559, 564-65 (9th Cir. 2011); I.R.S. v. Celenze, 78 F.3d 598 (10th Cir. 1996); Mimick v. United States, 952 F.2d 230, 232 (8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Bichara, 826 F.2d 1037, 1039 (11th Cir.1987). Mellon at no point argues that he was harmed or prejudiced by the delivery of summons to the address that he provided to the investigating IRS Agent; indeed, he responded to the summons. Therefore, the government has demonstrated good faith in issuing the summons.
3. Mellon's final argument is that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the government's petition to enforce the summons because it was improperly served. This argument is meritless. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1340, which confers on federal district courts subject matter jurisdiction over ""any civil action arising under any Act of Congress providing for internal revenue."" That includes IRS summons enforcement actions. And 28 U.S.C. § 1345 grants district courts subject matter jurisdiction over ""all civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States,"" including IRS summons enforcement suits. Mellon argues that I.R.C. section 7604(a) grants district courts subject-matter jurisdiction over summons enforcement proceedings, but requires proper service to confer jurisdiction. But Mellon does not demonstrate how violating this specific grant of subject-matter jurisdiction would strip the district court of its general grant of subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1340 and 1345. Mellon's other subject-matter jurisdiction arguments are similarly without merit.
Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.
[1]  Because we conclude that Mellon's dwelling or usual place of abode was his Fifth Avenue apartment, there is no need to remand this case to the district court with instructions to consider the effect of the Hague Service Convention and I.R.C. § 7701 on personal jurisdiction.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Suzanne M. Pulk appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Skretny, J.) entered October 13, 2016, accepting the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge (McCarthy, M.J.) and granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee David J. Winter on false arrest, malicious abuse of process, and substantive due process violation claims. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
This case arises from a property dispute involving Suzanne Pulk and the Town of North Collins (""the Town"") regarding whether a section of Rocky Mountain Road (""the Road""), which runs along her property, was abandoned by the Town. David J. Winter was the Highway Superintendent for the Town. The Road has been described as having three segments: upper, middle, and lower. The upper (southernmost) segment of the Road has never been closed or abandoned by the Town, and the parties agree that it is public and owned by the Town. After the events giving rise to this action occurred, the New York State Supreme Court concluded that the middle segment had been abandoned by the town, and had reverted to private ownership, i.e. to Pulk and her neighbors. The lower, northernmost segment of the Road runs in front of Pulk's home and driveway, providing access to her property; it has never been abandoned by the Town, although Pulk also believed that it was her property during the relevant time period.
In the summer of 2010, while Pulk was away from her property, the Town decided to dump roadway debris and other fill from a nearby construction project on the middle section of the Road to rebuild the Road, using the lower section of the Road to access the worksite. Pulk returned to her property sometime between August 28, 2010, and September 1, 2010, and discovered the debris.
On September 1, 2010, Winter informed Erie County Deputy Sheriff Brendan Connelly that there might be protestors blocking access to the construction site on the Road. Subsequently, Deputy Connelly drove to the intersection of New Oregon Road and the lower section of the Road. Upon arrival, Deputy Connelly observed that two vehicles were parked across the lower section of the Road, blocking the roadway. Pulk conceded that she parked the vehicles there in order ""to make sure that no one was able to get up to the middle [section].""
Deputy Connelly left the scene, and encountered Winter nearby. He informed Winter that vehicles were blocking the Road. Winter told Deputy Connelly that the vehicles needed to be moved so that work could be performed. Winter also informed Deputy Connelly that the Town's attorney had authorized the roadwork; Pulk disputes that the Town's attorney had in fact authorized it.[1]
Deputy Connelly and another deputy then returned to the area where Pulk's vehicles were blocking the Road. Deputy Connelly asked Pulk to move her vehicles, but she refused. When Pulk expressed her belief that she owned the lower and middle sections of the Road, the deputies informed her that she would need to go to court to resolve the ownership issue, and that she would be arrested if she did not move her vehicles. After she refused to do so for several minutes, Deputy Connelly placed Pulk under arrest for obstructing governmental administration.
The next day, Winter executed a sworn deposition in support of the criminal complaint for the charge, which included the following: ""The town's attorney was contacted before the work was started and gave authorization."" Aff. of Suzanne Pulk, Ex. 2 at 2, Pulk v. Winter, No. 13-cv-00877 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2015), ECF No. 45-3. Ultimately, the state court dismissed the charge against Pulk.
In subsequent New York State Court civil proceedings alleging the torts of trespass and nuisance, the state court ruled that the middle portion of the Road had been abandoned by the Town and reverted to private ownership, but that that the lower section, which Pulk had blocked with her vehicles, had not been abandoned.[2]
During the pendency of the state court proceedings, Pulk filed the instant action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 asserting numerous claims against Winter in his individual capacity. After Winter's motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part,[3] only claims for false arrest, malicious abuse of process, and substantive due process violations remained. Later, the district court, adopting the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation, granted summary judgment in favor of Winter with respect to Pulk's remaining claims.
On appeal, Pulk challenges the grant of summary judgment as to her false arrest and malicious abuse of process claims, but not as to her substantive due process claim.[4] ""We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor."" Kuebel v. Black & Decker Inc., 643 F.3d 352, 358 (2d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is appropriate only if ""there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
To prevail on a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for false arrest, a plaintiff must prove that: ""(1) the defendant intended to confine him, (2) the plaintiff was conscious of the confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement and (4) the confinement was not otherwise privileged."" Ackerson v. City of White Plains, 702 F.3d 15, 19 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). An arrest based upon probable cause is privileged; accordingly, ""[t]he existence of probable cause to arrest constitutes justification and is a complete defense to an action for false arrest."" Jenkins v. City of New York, 478 F.3d 76, 84 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, an individual may be liable for false arrest if he or she ""instigated the arrest and knew that there was no probable cause,"" as ""a person who knowingly gives false information to the police cannot then invoke the probable cause defense which might be available to the police acting upon the information given."" Rosario v. Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union, Local 10, 605 F.2d 1228, 1248 (2d Cir. 1979). As Pulk conceded below, there was probable cause to arrest her for obstructing governmental administration based upon: (1) the officers' observations that vehicles were blocking the road; and (2) Winter's statements that county vehicles needed to access the road.[5] Accordingly, she conceded that probable cause existed independent of Winter's statement regarding the attorney's approval.
Even if Pulk had not conceded that there was probable cause independent of Winter's allegedly false statement, we would find that such independent probable cause existed because there is no genuine dispute of fact that prior to Pulk's arrest, the Town's attorney (through an intermediary) told Winter that the Road had not been abandoned, and Winter passed that information on to the deputies. It was the public status of the Road that gave probable cause for Pulk's arrest, and Winter had a good faith basis for believing that the Town continued to own the Road and that the construction was permitted. Whether the Town's attorney affirmatively authorized the project as such contributed nothing to the probable cause analysis.
Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that Winter ""knew that there was no probable cause,"" Rosario, 605 F.2d at 1248, when he made the allegedly false statement, as is required for a false arrest claim predicated upon false statements to succeed. As we detailed above, probable cause existed regardless of whether the work that Pulk was obstructing had been affirmatively approved by the Town's attorney. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Winter on Pulk's false arrest claim.
With respect to Pulk's malicious abuse of process claim, we agree with the district court that Winter is entitled to qualified immunity. Thus, we need not address the parties' arguments regarding whether Winter employed legal process, or decide whether the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense to a malicious abuse of process claim. As this Court has noted, ""[t]here has been considerable confusion within our Circuit regarding whether probable cause is a complete defense to a claim of abuse of process under New York law."" Mangino v. Inc. Vill. of Patchogue, 808 F.3d 951, 958 (2d Cir. 2015). Under these circumstances, this entitles an official such as Winter to qualified immunity against a malicious abuse of process claim when probable cause exists. Id. at 959. As discussed above, probable cause to arrest existed independent of Winter's allegedly false statement. Accordingly, even if the deposition in support of the criminal complaint in which Winter made the allegedly false statement about attorney approval constitutes process, Winter is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the malicious abuse of process claim.[6]
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Pulk, as we must in evaluating a district court's grant of summary judgment, Kuebel v. Black & Decker Inc., 643 F.3d 352, 358 (2d Cir. 2011), we will assume for purposes of this appeal that this statement by Winter was in fact false.
[2]  Pulk received a judgment in her favor in the amount ot $18,500 against the Town and the county for trespass and nuisance concerning the middle section of the Road.
[3]  Pulk does not challenge the dismissal of these other claims on appeal. Accordingly, those claims are abandoned. See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, 71 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 1995).
[4]  Pulk has therefore also abandoned her substantive due process claim. See LoSacco, 71 F.3d at 92.
[5]  Under New York law,
A person is guilty of obstructing governmental administration when he intentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function or prevents or attempts to prevent a public servant from performing an official function, by means of intimidation, physical force or interference, or by means of any independently unlawful act. . . .
N.Y. Penal Law § 195.05.
[6]  Winter argues that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine deprives this court of jurisdiction. This argument fails. Pulk's state court action commenced on September 8, 2010, and was terminated on January 16, 2015. The federal action was commenced on August 29, 2013. The Supreme Court has held that ""[w]hen there is parallel state and federal litigation, Rooker-Feldman is not triggered simply by the entry of judgment in state court,"" and that ""the pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction."" Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 292 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, Rooker-Feldman does not ""support[ ] the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on the same or related question while the case remains sub judice in a federal court."" Id. We need not address Winter's separate res judicata argument.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
TrueNorth Capital Partners LLC and its subsidiary TNCP, LLC (collectively ""TrueNorth"") brought this contract action against various entities in the Hitachi, Ltd. corporate family (collectively ""Hitachi""), claiming entitlement to a $6.8 million ""Completion Fee"" allegedly due under the parties' written agreement. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Daniels, J.) granted summary judgment for Hitachi on two independent grounds, and TrueNorth now appeals. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
""In reviewing a written contract, a [] court's primary objective is to give effect to the intent of the parties as revealed by the language they chose to use."" Seiden Assocs., Inc. v. ANC Holdings, Inc., 959 F.2d 425, 428 (2d Cir. 1992). When, as here, the operative language is unambiguous, the proper effect to give it is a question of law that may be resolved on summary judgment. See id.
TrueNorth contracted to advise Hitachi in its efforts to invest in a ""Target"" company, which the contract defined as any ""ductile iron producer having production facilities in the U.S., Canada and/or Mexico."" App'x at 31. The contract guaranteed TrueNorth an up-front retainer and a monthly fee. A Completion Fee was contingent upon Hitachi's ""consummation of an[] Investment [in] a[] Selected Target."" Id. at 34 (emphasis added). The contract further provided that the parties ""shall agree in writing"" on which ""Targets"" constitute ""Selected Targets.""[1] Id. at 31. That unambiguous writing requirement dooms TrueNorth's claim.
TrueNorth claims that when Hitachi consummated an investment in Waupaca Foundry, Inc.—which was undisputedly a Target under the parties' contract—Hitachi was required to pay TrueNorth a Completion Fee of $6.8 million. Hitachi counters that TrueNorth's claim is foreclosed because the contract allowed for a Completion Fee only if Hitachi invested in a Selected Target, and the parties did not ""agree in writing"" that Waupaca was a Selected Target. The district court cited the absence of a written agreement designating Waupaca a Selected Target as one ground for awarding Hitachi summary judgment. On de novo review, see Sousa v. Marquez, 702 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2012), we affirm on that ground.
TrueNorth argues that the writing requirement was (1) satisfied or (2) waived.
1. TrueNorth asserts that ""writings between the parties. . . conclusively establish[ed] an agreement that Waupaca was a Selected Target."" Appellant's Br. at 25. This assertion is belied by the record. It is undisputed that in March 2012, the parties agreed in writing to a list of 22 Selected Targets, which did not include Waupaca.[2] And TrueNorth points to no subsequent writing in which Hitachi manifested its assent to any modification to that list.
TrueNorth identifies as the requisite writing its unilateral inclusion of Waupaca on spreadsheets summarizing its research efforts, which it emailed in updated versions to Hitachi three times during April 2012. Those spreadsheets were organized into tabs labeled ""Targets,"" ""Comments,"" and ""Unlikely""; but Waupaca never appeared on the ""Targets"" tab, which included only the companies on the parties' agreed-upon March 2012 list of Selected Targets. Moreover, Waupaca's inclusion on the spreadsheets was not inherently meaningful, given that TrueNorth conducted research on numerous companies that it concedes were not Selected Targets and included summaries of that research on similar spreadsheets that it also emailed to Hitachi.
Even assuming that, through its spreadsheets, TrueNorth communicated in writing its intent to add Waupaca to the list, no writing from Hitachi evinced its agreement. Hitachi did not respond to the emails that contained the spreadsheets, and no writing from Hitachi to TrueNorth so much as mentioned Waupaca. True, an email from Hitachi to TrueNorth attached an unaltered version of one of the spreadsheets, which included Waupaca; but the body of that email merely sought an update on information provided in the spreadsheet about a different company. This cannot satisfy the unambiguous contractual requirement that the parties ""agree in writing"" before a given Target may become a Selected Target capable of generating a Completion Fee, and we are ""required to give effect to"" that requirement. U.S. Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. Jenner, 168 F.3d 630, 632 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).
2. TrueNorth asserts in the alternative that Waupaca became a Selected Target notwithstanding the unambiguous force of the contract's writing requirement because that requirement was either modified or waived. This assertion lacks merit in view of the contract as a whole. See Postlewaite v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 411 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir. 2005) (""Contracts must be read as a whole. . . .""). The contract specifically stated that the parties could ""modif[y] . . . or waive[]"" its requirements only through a ""writing signed by the parties."" App'x at 36. It is undisputed that the parties did not execute a signed writing modifying or waiving the writing requirement.[3]
New York law (which the parties agree governs) enforces the requirement of a signed writing before the parties may depart from a contractual term. See, e.g., Towers Charter & Marine Corp. v. Cadillac Ins. Co., 894 F.2d 516, 521-22 (2d Cir. 1990) (citing N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law § 15-301). There are only two showings that a party can make in order to circumvent such a provision, and TrueNorth attempts to make only one of them: TrueNorth attempts to establish that the parties ""partial[ly] perform[ed]"" an unwritten agreement to depart from the writing requirement, and that the conduct allegedly constituting partial performance was ""unequivocally referable to the"" departure, meaning it was ""[in]compatible with the original agreement."" Id. at 522 (internal quotation marks omitted). TrueNorth cannot, ""as a matter of law,"" make such a showing. Id.
TrueNorth relies (in part) on Hitachi's apparent acquiescence to TrueNorth's memorialization in its initial spreadsheet of the Selected Targets list to which the parties agreed in writing. No reasonable factfinder could conclude from that conduct that Hitachi acceded to a new arrangement under which any company placed on a subsequent TrueNorth spreadsheet became a Selected Target once the spreadsheet was received by Hitachi over email without objection. To the contrary, that conduct was ""[]consistent with the agreement as written."" Id. ""[N]othing in the written agreement[] precluded"" TrueNorth from documenting its work in spreadsheets or required Hitachi ""to object"" if it did not endorse TrueNorth's organization of its spreadsheets. Id. TrueNorth fails to identify conduct that is ""explainable only [by the existence of a new] agreement."" Merrill Lynch Interfunding, Inc. v. Argenti, 155 F.3d 113, 122 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).
TrueNorth fares no better to the extent that it relies on Hitachi's oral grant of permission to TrueNorth to contact Waupaca. Hitachi authorized TrueNorth to contact numerous companies that (TrueNorth concedes) were not Selected Targets. This was consistent with the contract's requirement that TrueNorth abstain from ""contact[ing] any Target without [Hitachi's] approval."" App'x at 32 (emphasis added). As the district court noted, ""it [was] not inconsistent for [TrueNorth] to [contact] Waupaca with [Hitachi's] oral approval as a `Target,' but still lack [Hitachi's] written consent to designate Waupaca as a `Selected Target.'"" Truenorth Capital Partners LLC v. Hitachi Metals Am., LLC, No. 15 CIV. 651, 2017 WL 532407, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2017) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the conduct at issue ""is reasonably explained"" without reference to a departure from the contract as written. Argenti, 155 F.3d at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted).
In sum, TrueNorth cannot circumvent the contract's express proscription of unwritten departures. For the same reasons, its argument premised on ratification is foreclosed. See id.
We have considered TrueNorth's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  The distinction between Targets and Selected Targets was written into the contract at Hitachi's behest, after an earlier iteration required payment of a Completion Fee upon Hitachi's ""consummation of an[] Investment [in] any Target."" Appellee's Br. at 9.
[2]  The list actually included only 21 distinct entities, as one of the entities listed was owned by another, but both parties stipulate to the irrelevance of this discrepancy.
[3]  In contrast, the parties did execute a signed writing modifying other provisions in the contract—namely, those governing the agreement's duration.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
In 2010, APS Healthcare Bethesda, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of Tennessee to provide health care services to state employees. As part of this arrangement, APS agreed to hold health screening clinics at locations across the state beginning in January 2011. APS, in turn, subcontracted this task to Summit Health, Inc.
In December 2010, a series of emails were exchanged between Troy Watson (APS's point person for communications with Summit) and Jason Moczul (Summit's point person for communications with APS). In these emails, Watson provided Moczul with a tentative list of dates and locations for more than one hundred clinics that APS wanted Summit to hold in the first half of 2011. In response, Moczul asked Watson to provide him with ""expected participation"" figures for those clinics so that Summit would ""know how many staff would be needed in each site."" J.A. 1124. Watson provided these estimates, but cautioned that they were ""probably high."" J.A. 1141.
Summit began holding clinics in January 2011, despite the fact that the parties had not yet finalized an agreement memorializing the terms of their subcontracting relationship. Soon after the clinics began, it became obvious that Watson's participation estimates were, in fact, far too high, often more than doubling actual attendance.
Then, in early March 2011, Summit realized that it had been improperly providing APS access to its screening results—which included confidential health information about the state employees involved—without the two companies having first entered into a formal confidentiality agreement. Summit immediately cut off APS's access to its screening database and indicated that it would not restore access until the parties had finalized their contract. The parties quickly executed an agreement on March 15, 2011 (with an explicitly retroactive effective date of January 1, 2011), and Summit duly restored APS's access to its screening information.
The provisions of the contract relating to fees (Exhibit B) specified that APS would pay Summit $37 for each screening that it performed. However, Exhibit B also included a section on ""Standard Minimums,"" which provided that, for a given clinic, Summit would in no event be paid less than as if it had performed the greater of ""40 screenings, or 90% of Customer projection."" J.A. 67.
Two days after signing the agreement, Summit alerted APS that it understood this language to permit it to use Watson's participation estimates as APS's ""Customer projections."" That is, Summit intended to bill APS for each clinic by multiplying $37 by the largest of three numbers: (i) 40; (ii) 90% of Watson's participation estimate; and (iii) the actual number of screenings performed. Because Watson's estimates far exceeded actual attendance, Summit was seeking payment for more than twice as many screenings as it had actually performed.
APS expressed immediate alarm. The next day, March 18, APS employee Bob Hines directed Summit to cease relying on the Watson estimates and begin instead using the number of online appointments that had been made for each clinic as APS's ""Customer projections."" And beginning in April 2011, Watson alerted Moczul that APS would no longer provide Summit with participation estimates for upcoming clinics. In response, Moczul informed Watson that Summit would refuse to schedule any future clinics until it had received participation estimates for them. Watson ultimately relented, providing ""uniform estimate[s] of either 100 (for clinics in large cities) or 75 (for clinics not in large cities),"" which were far more accurate than the estimates he had provided back in December. J.A. 1118.
All in all, Summit performed nearly 50,000 screenings in the first six months of 2011, but invoiced APS for more than 60,000 additional screenings pursuant to its interpretation of the ""Standard Minimums"" provision. APS promptly paid Summit $37 for all screenings the company had actually performed, but withheld the portion of Summit's requested compensation attributable to these ""Standard Minimums.""
On December 30, 2011, Summit (which later assigned its claim to APEX Employee Wellness Services, Inc.) brought a breach of contract action against APS in the Southern District of New York. The district court granted partial summary judgment to Summit, holding (i) that the term ""Customer projection"" unambiguously referred to participation estimates provided by APS and (ii) that the Watson estimates plainly met that description. The district court also rejected a litany of contractual defenses asserted by APS, including equitable estoppel, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and no meeting of the minds.
The district court, however, set for a jury trial the issue of whether Summit was entitled to continue using Watson's estimates following APS's March 18, 2011 email directing Summit to cease using them. The jury ultimately returned a verdict for APS on this issue.
Both parties seek relief from this Court. APS argues that the district court erred in holding that the relevant language in the agreement was unambiguous, in rejecting its various contractual defenses, and hence in ordering it to pay Summit's requested pre-March 18 billings. For its part, APEX cross-appeals the district court's decision to send to the jury the question of whether Summit could continue using the Watson estimates as ""Customer projections"" following Hines's email on March 18. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We affirm in full the judgment of the district court. APS's primary argument is that the Watson estimates cannot qualify as ""Customer projection[s]"" because they were made before Summit started holding its clinics, whereas a projection is a forecast ""based on present trends."" APS Br. at 36 (emphasis added). We find this argument unpersuasive. Watson indicated in his deposition that he calculated his participation estimates by ascertaining the number of state employees who resided in the area surrounding each planned clinic and multiplying that figure by the percentage of those employees he predicted would ultimately attend the clinic. That sort of calculation falls comfortably within the common usage of the word ""projection."" And, in any event, the words ""projection"" and ""estimate"" were used interchangeably in the relevant provisions of Exhibit B, and there can be no serious dispute that Watson's ""participation estimates"" were at least estimates.
We also affirm the district court's rejection of APS's various defenses to performance under New York contract law. Because Summit substantially performed on its obligations under the agreement, and because any injury APS suffered can be attributed to its inaccurate participation estimates and misinterpretations of unambiguous contractual language, APS cannot avail itself of any of the defenses asserted. See, e.g., Hunt Ltd. v. Lifschultz Fast Freight, Inc., 889 F.2d 1274, 1278 (2d Cir. 1989); Da Silva v. Musso, 53 N.Y.2d 543, 552 (1981). We have also considered APS's remaining arguments and consider them to be without merit.
Finally, we reject APEX's cross-appeal of the district court's determination that APS created a factual dispute as to whether Summit was entitled to use the Watson estimates when calculating ""Standard Minimums"" for clinics held after March 18, 2011. Nothing in the agreement between Summit and APS specified how APS was to arrive at its participation estimates. There was therefore a question of fact as to whether, after March 18, Summit should (as the jury found) have used the number of online appointments for each clinic as APS's ""Customer projections"" or whether Summit could have instead continued to rely on the Watson estimates.
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the final judgment entered on July 10, 2017, is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff Daniel Suarez sues for employment discrimination under New York City's Fair Chance Act (""NYCFCA""), see N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(11)(a), based on the alleged failure of defendant Mosaic Sales Solutions US Operating Co., LLC (""Mosaic"") to follow certain procedures before rescinding Suarez's job offer after Mosaic discovered, through a background check, that Suarez had two misdemeanor convictions. Suarez here appeals from both the dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
The district court dismissed Suarez's complaint on finding that he failed to satisfy the $75,000 amount in controversy required for diversity jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). On review of a Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal, we examine factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo, mindful that the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction must demonstrate its existence by a preponderance of the evidence. See Morrison v. Nat'l Austl. Bank Ltd., 547 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2008).
Suarez's complaint seeks to recover ""in excess of $75,000"" but ""not more than $100,000"" in ""lost wages, compensatory damages, punitive damages,"" and attorney's fees and costs. App'x 37, 39. While we presume ""that the face of the complaint is a good faith representation of the actual amount in controversy,"" a defendant may rebut that presumption by demonstrating ""to a legal certainty that the plaintiff could not recover the amount alleged or that the damages alleged were feigned to satisfy jurisdictional minimums."" Colavito v. N.Y. Organ Donor Network, Inc., 438 F.3d 214, 221 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To do so, the defendant may present, and the court may consider, evidence outside the pleadings, including affidavits. See Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v. Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2000).
A Mosaic affidavit states that Suarez's anticipated job was seasonal, scheduled to last only 10 weeks, and part-time, consisting of 16 hours per week at $15 per hour, thus establishing potential actual back-pay damages of only $2,400. Moreover, Suarez's anticipated job was in fact eliminated within four weeks, resulting in only $960 in potential back pay. Suarez, for his part, purports to dispute that the job was temporary, but the most he attests to in his complaint is that he was advised that the job was to be a permanent position—not that it actually was permanent. At any rate, in his amended complaint filed on March 20, 2017, Suarez acknowledges that he ""ultimately found another job."" App'x 17, ¶ 15. Thus, even assuming the Mosaic job was permanent, the highest range of economic damages to which Suarez was entitled still would fail to close the amount-in-controversy gap. This supports the district court's determination that, as a matter of law or fact, Suarez's estimated damages would be less than $75,000.
In urging otherwise, Suarez maintains that he ""was extremely hurt, humiliated, and frustrated"" by Mosaic's rescinding the job offer, and that he ""gained weight"" and ""suffered from a great deal of stress . . . even though he ultimately found another job."" Id. Suarez argues that precedent supports a large compensatory damages award for such ""garden-variety"" emotional distress damages, despite his failure to allege any required medication or treatment. The argument fails because none of the cases on which he relies allege comparable facts. Rather, they present more serious injury. See Patterson v. Balsamico, 440 F.3d 104, 109, 120 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding jury's award of $100,000 in emotional distress damages where evidence of plaintiff's humiliation, embarrassment, and physical ailments followed his being sprayed with mace and taunted with racial slurs); MacMillan v. Millennium Broadway Hotel, 873 F. Supp. 2d 546, 559-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting new trial on compensatory and punitive damages awards unless, inter alia, plaintiff accepted reduced emotional distress award of $30,000 for hostile work environment based on race); Broome v. Biondi, 17 F. Supp. 2d 211, 223-26 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (upholding $114,000 emotional distress award based on willful and malicious racial discrimination and civil rights violations).
Nor can Suarez rely on punitive damages to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold. A ""trial court is plainly not compelled to accept a claim of punitive damages, however unwarranted, made for the purpose of conferring federal jurisdiction."" Zahn v. Int'l Paper Co., 469 F.2d 1033, 1033 n.1 (2d Cir. 1972). In any event, ""a claim for punitive damages is to be given closer scrutiny . . . than a claim for actual damages"" when calculating a jurisdictional amount. Id. ""[T]he standard for determining punitive damages under [N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107 et seq.] is whether the wrongdoer has engaged in discrimination with wilful or wanton negligence, or recklessness, or a conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such disregard."" Chauca v. Abraham, 2017 N.Y. Slip. Op. 08158, 2017 WL 5557932 (N.Y. Nov. 20, 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that standard here, the district court was hardly compelled to find that a likely punitive damages award would allow Suarez to satisfy the jurisdictional amount. Suarez submitted an email that he received from Mosaic stating that he had in fact passed Mosaic's background check, but that a ""recruiter, in a simple entry error,"" entered the wrong result. App'x 64. Mosaic ""greatly apologize[d] for this error,"" and offered to ""ensure that [Suarez] received an expedited interview"" for a number of other open positions at the company. Id. Even if these circumstances might demonstrate negligence by the recruiter, they do not manifest wanton negligence, recklessness, or a conscious disregard of Suarez's rights by Mosaic.
Finally, attorney's fees only calculate into the jurisdictional amount in controversy if they are ""recoverable as a matter of right."" Givens v. W.T. Grant Co., 457 F.2d 612, 614 (2d Cir. 1972), vacated on other grounds, 409 U.S. 56 (1972). Attorney's fees for NYCFCA violations are discretionary. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-502(g). Thus, the district court correctly did not consider them in calculating the amount in controversy here.
We have considered Suarez's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Because we conclude that Suarez's possible damages could not exceed $75,000, the district court correctly determined that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over Suarez's state claims. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Suarez's complaint, without prejudice to pursuit of his claims in an appropriate forum.

Before: CABRANES AND LIVINGSTON, Circuit Judges, and GOLDBERG, Judge.[*]
JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge.
The question presented is whether a flu shot reminder text message sent by a hospital violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (""TCPA""), 47 U.S.C. § 227.
This appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Alvin K. Hellerstein, Judge), Plaintiff-Appellant David Latner (""Latner"") challenges the District Court's decision granting Defendants-Appellants Mount Sinai Health System, Inc.'s (""Mt. Sinai"") and West Park Medical Group, P.C.'s (""WPMG"") motion for judgment on the pleadings.
In 2003, Latner went to a Mt. Sinai facility, WPMG, for a routine overall health examination, and reviewed and filled out new patient forms. He signed a New Patient health form containing his contact information and an Ambulatory Patient Notification Record that granted consent to Mt. Sinai to use his health information ""for payment, treatment and hospital operations purposes.""
In June 2011, Mt. Sinai hired a third party, PromptALERT, Inc., to send mass messages on behalf of Mt. Sinai, including transmitting flu shot reminder texts for WPMG. In November of that year, Latner returned to WPMG and declined any immunizations.
On September 19, 2014, he received the following text message from WPMG:
Its flu season again. Your PCP at WPMG is thinking of you! Please call us at 212-247-8100 to schedule an appointment for a flu shot. (XXX-XXX-XXXX, WPMG).
A-26. Latner did not receive any further text messages from WPMG. In limited discovery below, Mt. Sinai stated that it sent flu shot reminder texts to all active patients of WPMG who had visited the office in the three years prior to the date of the texts; Latner's 2011 visit fell within that timeline.
Latner filed suit, alleging that Mt. Sinai violated §227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA.[1] On December 14, 2016, the District Court granted Mt. Sinai's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the case. This timely appeal followed.
We review a district court's order granting a defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo. Hayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d 150, 160 (2d Cir. 2010). We accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. We may affirm the decision of the District Court for any reason supported by the record. Beal v. Stern, 184 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir. 1999).
The TCPA makes it unlawful to send texts or place calls to cell phones through automated telephone dialing systems, except under certain exemptions or with consent. 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii). Congress delegated authority to issue regulations under the TCPA to the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC""). 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(2). Prior express consent is an affirmative defense to liability under the TCPA. The FCC first interpreted the TCPA's prior-express consent provision in a 1992 Order implementing the TCPA, where it concluded that ""persons who knowingly release their phone numbers have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the number which they have given, absent instructions to the contrary."" In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 7 FCC Rcd. 8752, 8768-69, ¶ 31 (1992). In 2008, the FCC extended this proposition to cell phone numbers. In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 23 FCC Rcd. 559, 564 ¶ 9 (2008) (holding that provision of cell phone numbers as part of hospital admissions constituted prior express consent to receive calls relating to medical debt). In 2014, the FCC clarified that ""the scope of [an individual's prior express] consent must be determined upon the facts of each situation."" Matter of GroupMe, Inc./Skype Commc'ns S.A.R.L Petition for Expedited Declaratory Ruling Rules & Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 29 F.C.C. Rcd. 3442, 3446, ¶ 11 (March 27, 2014).
In 2012, the FCC devised a ""Telemarketing Rule"" requiring ""prior written consent for autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls."" In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 27 FCC Rcd. 1830, 1838 (2012) (emphasis added). The FCC exempts from written consent calls to wireless cell numbers if the call ""delivers a `health care' message made by, or on behalf of, a `covered entity' or its `business associate,' as those are defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule."" 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(2) (the ""Healthcare Exception""). HIPAA defines health care to include ""care, services, or supplies related to the health of an individual."" 45 C.F.R. § 160.103. It exempts from its definition of marketing all communications made ""[f]or treatment of an individual by a health care provider . . . or to direct or recommend alternative treatments"" to the individual. Id. at 164.501.
The District Court granted Mt. Sinai's motion on the pleadings, holding that the text message qualified for the FCC's Healthcare Exception. A-210. As an initial matter, we note that the District Court's analysis was incomplete. It (correctly) determined that the text message ""deliver[ed] a `health care' message made by, or on behalf of, a `covered entity' or its `business associate,' as those are defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule,"" 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(2). But it did not then go on to determine whether Latner provided his prior express consent to receive the text message. See id.; see also In the Matter of Rules & Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 30 F.C.C. Rcd. 7961, 8030, ¶ 143 n.481 (July 10, 2015) (""2015 Order"") (noting that calls that qualify for the Healthcare Exception ""are exempt from the . . . written consent requirement but are still covered by the [TCPA's] general consent requirement"").[2]
Nonetheless, we affirm the District Court's judgment on the grounds that, considering ""the facts of the situation,"" the text message did indeed fall within ""the scope of [Latner's prior express] consent."" See 29 F.C.C. Rcd. at 3446, ¶ 11. Latner provided his cell phone number when he first visited WPMG in 2003. He also signed a consent form acknowledging receipt of various privacy notices. A-130. In signing this form, Latner agreed that Mt. Sinai could share his information for ""treatment"" purposes, and the privacy notices stated that WPMG could use Latner's information ""to recommend possible treatment alternatives or health-related benefits and services."" A-139. Considering the circumstances, we hold that Latner provided his prior express consent to receiving a single text message about a ""health-related benefit[]"" that might have been of interest to him.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the December 14, 2016 judgment of the District Court.
[*]   The Honorable Richard W. Goldberg, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.
[1]  47 U.S.C. § 227 (b)(1)(A)(iii) provides that, ""It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States, or any person outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States . . . to make any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded voice . . . to any telephone number assigned to a . . . cellular telephone service.""
[2]  It is also possible that the District Court held that the text message fell under the TCPA's Healthcare Treatment Exemption. The FCC introduced the Healthcare Treatment Exemption in 2015. It exempts companies from receiving consent from consumers before making certain health-related communications to them. In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 30 FCC Rcd. 7961, ¶147. It mandates that senders must not charge recipients for receiving health-related communications and must include an explicit opt-out option in any message. The order also narrows the scope of the required prior express consent under the TCPA, stating that for a recipient to have granted consent, ""the call must be closely related to the purpose for which the telephone number was originally provided."" Id., n. 474 (emphasis added). If that is the case, we hold that this exemption does not apply here because the FCC only introduced it after Mt. Sinai sent the flu reminder text message received by Latner. There is no language in the 2015 FCC order suggesting any intent to make the Exception retroactive, much less the justification for any asserted retroactivity, precluding its application in this instance.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Cara Munn was a student at The Hotchkiss School (""Hotchkiss"") when she contracted tick-borne encephalitis (""TBE"") during a school trip to China. See Munn v. Hotchkiss Sch., 24 F. Supp. 3d 155, 163 (D. Conn. 2014). Munn's parents sued Hotchkiss on behalf of their minor daughter, alleging that the school's negligence caused her injuries. A jury found for Munn and awarded her nearly $41.5 million in damages. Hotchkiss appealed, claiming that the judgment was in error because (1) Munn's injuries were not foreseeable, (2) Connecticut public policy did not support imposing such a duty on a school, (3) the non-economic damages awarded were excessive, (4) the district court abused its discretion by excluding or including expert testimony from various witnesses, (5) the jury instruction on foreseeability was misleading, (6) there was insufficient evidence that Munn was infected on Mt. Pan, where she claimed she was bitten, and (7) the district court erred by excluding a release that Munn and her mother signed.
On August 3, 2015, we held that there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury's finding that Munn's TBE injuries were foreseeable. Munn v. Hotchkiss Sch., 795 F.3d 324, 329-30 (2d Cir. 2015). We also certified two questions to the Connecticut Supreme Court:
(1) Does Connecticut public policy support imposing a duty on a school to warn about or protect against the risk of a serious insect-borne disease when it organizes a trip abroad? (2) If so, does an award of approximately $41.5 million in favor of the plaintiffs, $31.5 million of which are non-economic damages, warrant remittitur?
Id. at 337.
In an August 11, 2017 opinion, the Connecticut Supreme Court responded that (1) Connecticut public policy ""does not preclude imposing a duty on a school to warn about or to protect against the risk of a serious insect-borne disease when organizing a trip abroad,"" Munn v. Hotchkiss Sch., 326 Conn. 540, 569 (2017), and (2) remittitur was not warranted because this ""award, although sizeable, fell within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages,"" id. Following the Connecticut Supreme Court's response, we have considered Hotchkiss's remaining arguments from its original and supplemental briefs and find them to be without merit. In doing so, we assume familiarity with the underlying facts and our prior opinion.
First, Hotchkiss argues that the district court's admission of expert testimony from one witness and the exclusion of such testimony from another was error. ""We review a district court's determination to admit or exclude expert testimony under Daubert for abuse of discretion."" Amorgianos v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 303 F.3d 256, 264 (2d Cir. 2002). Under this ""highly deferential"" standard, Zuchowicz v. United States, 140 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir. 1998), ""[a] decision to admit or exclude expert . . . testimony is not an abuse of discretion unless it is `manifestly erroneous,'"" Amorgianos, 303 F.3d at 265. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 lays out the standards for admissible expert witness testimony:
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702. As a gatekeeper, a judge has ""the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand."" Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 580 (1993).
Hotchkiss contends that Munn's standard-of-care expert, Peter Tarlow, should not have been admitted as an expert because of his lack of experience on the responsibility of secondary schools conducting study abroad programs. As the district court pointed out, however, Tarlow had worked in the tourism management industry for over twenty years and had written books and scholarly articles about risk assessment for travel abroad generally. Tarlow used this general experience as a risk manager for adults to extrapolate what the specific standard of care for secondary schools would have been, and tested his opinions by conducting additional research into the practices of specific secondary schools. We are satisfied that this represented the ""level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field."" Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999). Accordingly, the district court's decision to admit Tarlow's testimony was not ""manifestly erroneous.""
Hotchkiss next argues that the district court erred by striking its expert on the standard of care, William Fluharty. This is a close question. The district court concluded that Fluharty ""fabricated the supposed support for his opinion testimony and misrepresented his personal, lay opinions as reliable expert opinions."" Munn v. Hotchkiss Sch., 24 F. Supp. 3d 155, 203 (D. Conn. 2014). That conclusion is supported by the record. Testimony revealed that Fluharty's purported expertise came from communications with only four schools. Additionally, his testimony about the contents of his own survey was at best confused and at worst misleading, particularly as to the key question of whether his survey included questions about preventing insect-borne diseases. Even though we might have reached a different conclusion if we were determining in the first instance whether to exclude the entirety of Fluharty's testimony, we cannot say that in doing so the district court abused its discretion. See Shatkin v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 727 F.2d 202, 208 (2d Cir. 1984) (upholding exclusion of expert testimony ""riddled with errors"").
Second, Hotchkiss contends that the jury instruction on foreseeability was erroneous. ""We review a jury instruction challenge de novo, but we will reverse only where the charge, viewed as a whole, demonstrates prejudicial error."" United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 247 (2d Cir. 2012). Hotchkiss argues that the foreseeability instruction was misleading and confusing. In particular, Hotchkiss challenges language in the middle of the charge, which, Hotchkiss argues, incorrectly suggested that if a harm is sufficiently grave, the risk need not be appreciable. The relevant sentences state:
If the risk is an appreciable one, and the possible consequences are serious, the question is not one of mathematical probability alone. As the gravity of a possible harm increases, the apparent likelihood of its occurrence need be correspondingly less to generate a duty of precaution.
App'x at 1411. Considering the charge in its entirety, as we must, we find no error. See Coppola, 671 F.3d at 247. The entire instruction repeatedly informed the jury that Hotchkiss could be liable only for harms it could foresee. See App'x at 1409 (""A person is negligent if the person, without intending to do harm, does something or fails to do something, a reasonable person knew or should have known creates an unreasonable risk of injury to another."" (emphasis added)); id. at 1411 (""A defendant is not negligent unless he knew or reasonably should have known of a risk."" (emphasis added)); id. (""The school can only be held responsible for failing to protect Cara against a risk that a reasonable school should have foreseen.""). Moreover, the language that Hotchkiss challenges is taken nearly verbatim from Connecticut Supreme Court precedent. See LePage v. Horne, 262 Conn. 116, 131 n.16 (2002). Thus, taken as a whole, the instruction did not mislead the jury about Connecticut law on foreseeability.
Third, Hotchkiss challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that Munn was infected with TBE during the Mt. Pan trip. We will ""overturn a verdict only if there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury's findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the appellant that reasonable and fair minded [persons] could not arrive at a verdict against the appellant."" Gronowski v. Spencer, 424 F.3d 285, 292 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). ""Although we review the district court's denial of a Rule 50 motion de novo, we are bound by the same stern standards."" Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).
We need not address whether this argument was waived because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's conclusion that Mt. Pan was where Munn was bitten. It was on Mt. Pan that for three to four hours Munn walked through a forested area—the type of environment where testimony established that infection with TBE is likely to occur. Munn testified that Mt. Pan was the only such area she visited while in China. Dr. Stuart Rose also testified that no other location on the trip would have been a likely place for an encounter with ticks. Furthermore, Munn testified that during that hike she was bitten by an insect on her left arm. That bite immediately started to itch, turned red, and swelled to two to three inches in diameter. Munn also developed symptoms of TBE 10 days after the trip to Mt. Pan, which, Dr. Rose testified, is consistent with TBE's incubation period. Given this evidence, we cannot say that there was ""such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury's findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture."" Gronowski, 424 F.3d at 292.
Lastly, Hotchkiss argues that the district court erred when it excluded a waiver that Munn and her mother signed purporting to release Hotchkiss from liability. The waiver ""release[d] and discharge[d]"" Hotchkiss from responsibility ""except to the extent that the liability, damage, injury, loss, accident, or illness is caused by the sole negligence or willful misconduct"" of Hotchkiss and its agents. Attach. to Mot. in Lim. 15, ECF No. 143-1, 3:09-cv-00919. Hotchkiss agrees that the waiver did not preclude liability for claims resulting from ""defendant's `sole negligence.'"" Reply at 23. Notably, Hotchkiss did not ask for a jury interrogatory specifically addressing the question of any possible comparative fault on the part of Munn's parents. In any event, we agree with the district court for the reasons stated in its thorough opinion that Hotchkiss ""had no viable claim of parental comparative negligence."" Munn v. Hotchkiss Sch., 24 F. Supp. 3d 155, 193 (D. Conn. 2014). Furthermore, the only affirmative defense included in the jury instructions concerned Munn's potential comparative fault. So, when the jury found Munn ""0%"" responsible for her injuries, it necessarily concluded that Hotchkiss and Hotchkiss alone was liable for her injuries. See id. In other words, even if the waiver was unambiguous and not void—questions that we need not consider—the waiver could not have protected Hotchkiss from liability when, as here, the school was solely responsible for the student's injuries.
We have considered all of Hotchkiss's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

CURTIS HARDAWAY, pro se, Windsor, C.T.
JONATHAN H. BEAMON, Senior Assistant Corporation Counsel, Hartford, CT for Defendant-Appellee.
Before: WINTER, CALABRESI, and POOLER, Circuit Judges.
POOLER, Circuit Judge.
Plaintiff-Appellant Curtis Hardaway, proceeding pro se, appeals from the August 31, 2016 judgment sua sponte dismissing his third amended complaint against the City of Hartford, the Hartford Department of Public Works (the ""Department""), and five Doe defendants. Hardaway, an African American and former employee of the Department, alleged that he was subjected to discrimination and retaliation after he filed complaints against the Department with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (""OSHA""). As relevant here, the district court dismissed Hardaway's Title VII claims and a state law claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress because Hardaway failed to plead facts relating to administrative exhaustion.[1]
Because we hold that administrative exhaustion under Title VII is an affirmative defense, we reverse the district court's judgment as to Counts I, III and V of the third amended complaint, and remand for further proceedings.
BACKGROUND
Hardaway worked for the Department of Public Works for over 20 years. In 2011, he noticed worsening safety violations by the Department. In late 2013, after being placed in a ""dangerous life and death hazardous working environment,"" Hardaway photographed the safety violations. Third Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 11-12, ECF No. 26, Hardaway v. Hartford Public Works Dep't, No. 16-cv-00115 (D. Conn. July 18, 2016). When he showed his white supervisor the photographs, the supervisor told Hardaway to get back to work. According to Hardaway, his supervisor would not have treated him that way were he white. Further, his ""[w]hite coworkers [were] not forced to work in the dangerous working environment."" Id. at ¶ 24.
Following his supervisor's inaction, Hardaway filed a complaint with OSHA regarding his working conditions. Thereafter, he was threatened, harassed, and intimidated. He was identified as a ""troublemaker,"" called ""bitch, gay, a person that will complain to OSHA,"" and told to ""`play ball' and stop asking safety questions."" Id. at ¶ 13. Additionally, he was denied overtime and suspended because of his OSHA complaint. In August 2014, a white supervisor told Hardaway that if he stopped reporting safety violations, his demotion would ""go away"" and his overtime would be ""reinstated."" Id. at ¶ 14. Hardaway then filed another complaint with OSHA, asserting discrimination and retaliation because of his prior OSHA complaint. In February 2015, he was told to ""stop acting like a bitch running to OSHA like a little girl"" and that if he stopped reporting safety violations ""everything [would] go back to normal."" Id. at ¶ 15. He filed another complaint with OSHA and was fired three months later. According to Hardaway, he would not have been fired were he white.
Hardaway brought suit on January 26, 2016, alleging discrimination and retaliation claims. On August 31, 2016, the district court sua sponte dismissed Hardaway's third amended complaint, adopting the recommended ruling of the magistrate judge. The district court reasoned that Hardaway had pled sufficient facts to support Title VII claims of employment discrimination and a hostile work environment, but those claims nonetheless were not viable because Hardaway failed to plead facts relating to administrative exhaustion with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""). The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.
DISCUSSION
We review de novo a district court's sua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). Giano v. Goord, 250 F.3d 146, 149-150 (2d Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002). To avoid dismissal, a complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). We afford a pro se litigant ""special solicitude"" by interpreting a complaint filed pro se ""to raise the strongest claims that it suggests."" Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal punctuation omitted).
""As a precondition to filing a Title VII claim in federal court, a plaintiff must first pursue available administrative remedies and file a timely complaint with the EEOC."" Deravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 2003); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e) and (f) (providing procedures and deadlines for filing charges with the EEOC and, following receipt of a right-to-sue letter, in court); Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A., 274 F.3d 683, 686 (2d Cir. 2001) (describing Title VII exhaustion as requiring that ""a claimant . . . file[] a timely complaint with the EEOC and obtain[] a right-to-sue letter""). We have previously noted that exhaustion is ""an essential element of Title VII's statutory scheme."" Francis v. City of New York, 235 F.3d 763, 768 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Butts v. City of New York Dep't of Hous. Pres. & Dev., 990 F.2d 1397, 1401 (2d Cir. 1993)). However, we have repeatedly held that ""the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a precondition to bringing a Title VII claim in federal court, rather than a jurisdictional requirement."" Id. at 768 (citations omitted); see also Fowlkes v. Ironworkers Local 40, 790 F.3d 378, 385 (2d Cir. 2015) (""[T]he failure of a Title VII plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies raises no jurisdictional bar to the claim proceeding in federal court.""). Thus the Title VII exhaustion requirement is ""subject to equitable defenses."" Fowlkes, 790 F.3d at 384.
This case calls on us to answer a question we have not yet squarely considered: which party bears the burden of pleading and proving exhaustion in a Title VII case brought by a non-federal employee. We have considered closely related issues previously. In Townsend v. Home for the Homeless, Inc., we decided the narrower question of whether compliance with the filing deadlines established by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f) operated as an affirmative defense, and found, in a non-precedential summary order, that it did. 28 F. App'x 85, 86 (2d Cir. 2002) (Title VII claim was not barred for failure to comport with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) deadline requirements because ""the 90-day time limit is an affirmative defense that is waived if not pled""). We have also held that failure to exhaust administrative remedies ""can be asserted by the government as an affirmative defense,"" in Title VII suits brought by federal employees. Belgrave v. Pena, 254 F.3d 384, 386 (2d Cir. 2001). Title VII claims brought by federal employees share certain statutory requirements with other Title VII claims, but are subject to separate statutory provisions and regulations. See § 2000e-16(e), (d) (incorporating portions of Title VII statutory scheme for non-federal employee claims); see also Green v. Brennan, 136 S. Ct. 1769, 1775, n. 4 (2016).
Several of our sister circuits have considered various strains of the question now before us, and ruled that Title VII exhaustion operated as an affirmative defense, with the burden on the defendant. Laouini v. CLM Freight Lines, Inc., 586 F.3d 473, 475 (7th Cir. 2009) (""Failure to timely file an administrative charge is an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof . . . therefore rests on the defendant.""); see also Payan v. Aramark Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. Partnership, 495 F.3d 1119, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that the filing deadlines established by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) function as a statute of limitations, and ""because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff filed beyond the limitations period""); Garner v. G.D. Searle Pharm. Co., 581 F. App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2014) (analyzing Title VII exhaustion as an ""affirmative defense"") (unpublished opinion). In the overlapping context of federal employment Title VII claims, numerous circuit courts have similarly held that exhaustion is an affirmative defense. See Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (""[E]xhaustion of administrative remedies is an affirmative defense,"" and thus ""the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving it.""); see also Williams v. Runyon, 130 F.3d 568, 573 (3d Cir. 1997) (""Because failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense, the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving that the plaintiff has failed to exhaust administrative remedies.""); Kraus v. Presidio Tr. Facilities Div./Residential Mgmt. Branch, 572 F.3d 1039, 1046 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2009) (""Whether a plaintiff in a Title VII action has timely exhausted her administrative remedies is an affirmative defense, [so] the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving it."") (quoting Bowden, 106 F.3d at 437) (internal quotation marks omitted); Lockett v. Potter, 259 F. App'x 784, 786 (6th Cir. 2008) (""Failure to exhaust administrative remedies in a timely manner is an affirmative defense, and the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving this failure."") (citing Williams, 130 F.3d at 573) (unpublished opinion). However, at least one Court of Appeals rejected this view, ruling instead that compliance with Section 2000e-5(e)(1)'s filing requirements is ""a condition precedent to suit and thus a burden for plaintiffs to carry."" Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., 497 F.3d 1160, 1167 (10th Cir. 2007).
We think the better resolution is the approach taken by the majority of our sister circuits. Accordingly, we hold that the burden of pleading and proving Title VII exhaustion lies with defendants and operates as an affirmative defense.
The Supreme Court has previously held that ""filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.""[2] Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982); see also Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990) (holding that timing requirements applicable to Title VII suits against the federal government are similarly subject to equitable tolling). While Zipes centered on only certain aspects of exhaustion, it made plain that a plaintiff's failure to fully comply with the remedial administrative scheme envisioned by Title VII does not preclude judicial review, as had been suggested. Rather, the administrative filing requirements operate ""like a statute of limitations,"" and could be excused under certain doctrines. Zipes, 455 U.S. at 393. By invoking a generalized statute of limitations, the Supreme Court also indicated that exhaustion should be treated as an affirmative defense, since statutes of limitation typically function as affirmative defenses in federal litigation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 (c)(1).
Our decision also follows from other areas where administrative exhaustion is an affirmative defense. In Jones v. Bock, the Supreme Court found that the exhaustion requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (""PLRA"") functioned as an affirmative defense. 549 U.S. 199, 212 (2007). The Court drew support for its decision from the absence of any indication in the PLRA that exhaustion should be pled by the plaintiff, writing, ""[t]his is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense."" Id. So too in Title VII. The statutory scheme makes no mention of pleading requirements or questions of proof related to exhaustion. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5. Thus we see no need to depart from the general rule.
Here, the district court sua sponte dismissed Hardaway's Title VII claims for failure to exhaust, or plead other facts that would relieve him of the obligation to file a complaint with the EEOC. The district court explicitly found that Hardaway had otherwise stated viable Title VII claims. Thus the district court erroneously dismissed Hardaway's third amended complaint by holding that the exhaustion requirement is a pleading requirement incumbent on a Title VII plaintiff, rather than an affirmative defense.
Finally, the district court dismissed Hardaway's state law claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hardaway's state claim in the absence of a viable federal claim. Hardaway's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim and his Title VII claims ""derive from a common nucleus of operative fact."" Shahriar v. Smith & Wollensky Rest. Grp., Inc., 659 F.3d 234, 245 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Briarpatch Ltd., L.P. v. Phoenix Pictures, Inc., 373 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir. 2004)). Both relate to the verbal harassment that Hardaway alleges he suffered following his OSHA complaints. As a result, supplemental jurisdiction over Hardaway's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim is now proper, since Hardaway has presented viable Title VII claims.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, with respect to Hardaway's Title VII claims, Counts I and III, and his state law negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, Count V, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court, and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
[1]  In a separate summary order filed concurrently with this opinion, we affirm the district court's holdings as to Hardaway's remaining claims.
[2]  In so holding, the Supreme Court rejected outright an argument that exhaustion did not operate as ""an affirmative defense analogous to a statute of limitations."" Zipes, 455 U.S. at 389.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.
Tyrone Hicks appeals from a judgment of the District Court (Crotty, J.) dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. On appeal, Hicks challenges the dismissal of his fair trial and malicious prosecution claims. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.[1]
We first address Hicks's fair trial claim based on the defendant officers' alleged fabrication of information. To state such a fair trial claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that investigating officers fabricated information that was likely to influence a jury's verdict, forwarded that information to prosecutors, and that the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of life, liberty, or property as a result. Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 279 (2d Cir. 2016). And in assessing the claim, we accept all of the well-pleaded factual allegations in Hicks's complaint as true and draw all inferences in his favor. Lopez v. Jet Blue Airways, 662 F.3d 593, 596 (2d Cir. 2011).
Hicks's complaint alleges, among other things, that the officers used impermissibly suggestive identification procedures to encourage the victim, T.T., to identify Hicks as her assailant from a photographic array and then failed to disclose the use of those suggestive procedures to the District Attorney's Office. Had that been the only allegation, we would have affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the fabrication claim because the state criminal court assumed the procedures were suggestive, excluded the resulting identification, and determined that there was an independent basis for T.T.'s later identifications of Hicks as her attacker. But the complaint alleges not merely that the photographic array was in some general way suggestive, but also alleges that (1) a detective deliberately gave T.T. prejudicial information about Hicks during the photo array procedure and hid this misconduct from the court and prosecutors; (2) the officers lied to the prosecutors that Hicks had bragged about being the ""Bronx Rapist"" and that Hicks's mother told them that Hicks was the person depicted in the sketch T.T. had created; (3) Hicks's parole officer ultimately refused to credit T.T.'s identification of Hicks after interviewing T.T.; (4) the officers failed to preserve the photographic array from which T.T. identified Hicks; and (5) two other victims were unable to identify Hicks. In view of Hicks's ultimate exoneration, these allegations together raise a plausible inference that the officers fabricated information that was likely to influence a jury's verdict and that they forwarded that information to the prosecutors. Hicks has also adequately alleged that he was arrested as a result of the fabricated information and that the information influenced the prosecutors' ""decision to pursue charges rather than to dismiss the complaint without further action[.]"" Garnett, 838 F.3d at 277. We therefore conclude that the complaint states a plausible fair trial claim based on the fabrication of information, and vacate the dismissal of that claim.
Hicks also challenges the dismissal of his claims that the officers violated his fair trial rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by withholding from prosecutors and defense counsel three pieces of material exculpatory evidence. None of these claims is persuasive. First, the trial transcript shows that Hicks's counsel had sufficient information about other victims' failure to identify Hicks as the perpetrator of similar attacks to use that information in his defense at trial. See United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 618 (2d Cir. 1982). Second, the results of the analysis of a latent fingerprint recovered from T.T.'s front door did not constitute Brady material, because there is no reason to assume that a fingerprint on an apartment door, which is accessible to many people, was left by the perpetrator of the crime or the person who left the threatening notes. See United States v. Sessa, 711 F.3d 316, 321-22 (2d Cir. 2013). Finally, Hicks does not allege facts sufficient to support a conclusion that the existence of the second note should be considered exculpatory. We therefore affirm the District Court's dismissal of Hicks's claims based on Brady.
As a final fair trial challenge, Hicks urges that his complaint adequately alleges that the officers violated his fair trial right to have the police conduct an adequate investigation. Hicks cites no authority for the proposition that there is a stand-alone fair trial claim based on officers' failure to conduct an adequate investigation. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed this version of Hicks's fair trial claim.
Finally, Hicks argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his malicious prosecution claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and New York law. We agree. ""[T]he merits of a claim for malicious prosecution under [Section] 1983 are governed by state law."" Dufort v. City of New York, 874 F.3d 338, 350 (2d Cir. 2017). To state a malicious prosecution claim under New York law, a plaintiff must allege ""the commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding against [him]; the termination of the proceeding in [his] favor; [3] that there was no probable cause for the proceeding; and [4] that the proceeding was instituted with malice."" Mitchell v. City of New York, 841 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). ""When raising a malicious prosecution claim under Section 1983, a plaintiff must also show a seizure or other perversion of proper legal procedures implicating the claimant's personal liberty and privacy interests under the Fourth Amendment."" Id. (quotation marks omitted). It is true that Hicks's indictment by a grand jury creates a presumption of probable cause. But under New York law the presumption can be rebutted by showing ""that the police witnesses have not made a complete and full statement of facts either to the Grand Jury or the District Attorney, that they have misrepresented or falsified evidence, that they have withheld evidence or otherwise acted in bad faith[.]"" Colon v. City of New York, 60 N.Y.2d 78, 82-83 (1983). Here, Hicks rebutted the presumption at the motion to dismiss stage by alleging that the officers provided fabricated evidence to the prosecutors, as described above. The allegations in the complaint also satisfy the other elements of a malicious prosecution claim under both New York law and Section 1983: the officers commenced the criminal proceeding, see Dufort, 874 F.3d at 353, malice may be inferred from the actual lack of probable cause, see Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 131 (2d Cir. 1997), Hicks was detained, and Hicks's criminal proceeding ultimately terminated in his favor with his exoneration. We therefore vacate the District Court's dismissal of Hicks's malicious prosecution claims.
We have considered Hicks's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Ernie Telian appeals from a May 13, 2015 Order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York dismissing, on a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), his malicious prosecution claim, and from a January 14, 2017 Order dismissing his equal protection and conspiracy claims, pursuant to a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Telian argues on appeal that: (1) the underlying criminal action against him which forms the basis of his malicious prosecution claim was terminated in his favor; (2) the district court ignored disputed material facts in his equal protection claim and drew every inference in the defendants' favor, in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; and (3) since the dismissals must be reversed as to his malicious prosecution and equal protection claims, his conspiracy claim should be reinstated. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. As to the malicious prosecution claim, Telian argues that the district court incorrectly determined that the underlying criminal matter was not terminated in his favor.[1]
""We review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting as true all factual claims in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Fink v. Time Warner Cable, 714 F.3d 739, 740-41 (2d Cir. 2013). ""In order to prevail on a § 1983 claim against a state actor for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must show a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, and establish the elements of a malicious prosecution claim under state law."" Fulton v. Robinson, 289 F.3d 188, 195 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted). To establish a malicious prosecution claim under New York law, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) a proceeding was commenced or continued against him, (2) with malice and without probable cause, and (3) was terminated in his favor. Id.
The underlying criminal matter in Telian's malicious prosecution claim was not terminated in his favor. While the County Court did reverse the Justice Court's decision finding Telian liable for building code violations, the Town of Delhi then appealed the County Court's decision. So the County Court's decision did not end the litigation, it remained a live controversy. Final termination occurred when the Town and Telian entered into a ""Stipulation of Settlement."" Joint App'x at 251-52. Under the Settlement, (1) the Town agreed to withdraw two appeals in cases against Telian, as well as move to vacate a prior judgment against Telian, and (2) Telian ""sought and obtained compliance"" with the relevant building and zoning laws, despite his earlier claim that, because he did not own the property, he was under no obligation to do so. Id. In return, the parties would ""mutually agree to withdraw[] the appeals in the above captioned matters[.]"" Id. at 251. ""A termination is not favorable to the accused . . . if the charge is withdrawn or the prosecution abandoned pursuant to a compromise with the accused,"" Rothstein v. Carriere, 373 F.3d 275, 286 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted, alteration in original), and that is exactly what occurred here: the Town withdrew its appeal against Telian pursuant to a compromise with him.[2]
2. Telian next argues that, in dismissing his equal protection claim, the district court ignored disputed material facts and resolved fact questions that should have been left to a jury. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Sousa v. Marquez, 702 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2012); see also Lederman v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 731 F.3d 199, 202 (2d Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).
Telian argues that he was subject to selective enforcement, in violation of the Equal Protection clause. ""To prevail on a claim of selective enforcement,"" plaintiffs must demonstrate: ""(1) that they were treated differently from other similarly situated individuals, and (2) that such differential treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person."" Harlen Assocs. v. Inc. Vill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (""successful equal protection claims brought by a `class of one'"" must allege that the plaintiff has ""been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment"").
""[C]lass-of-one plaintiffs must show an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves."" Clubside, Inc. v. Valentin, 468 F.3d 144, 159 (2d Cir. 2006). In order to demonstrate sufficient similarity to a comparator, the plaintiff must establish that:
(i) no rational person could regard the circumstances of the plaintiff to differ from those of a comparator to a degree that would justify the differential treatment on the basis of a legitimate government policy; and (ii) the similarity in circumstances and difference in treatment are sufficient to exclude the possibility that the defendants acted on the basis of a mistake.
Id. (internal citation omitted).
The district court considered whether a reasonable juror could conclude that that Telian and his comparators were similarly situated, and identified a rational basis for every instance of differential treatment with a comparator. In doing so, the district court did not rely on any disputed fact; rather, it relied on facts which Telian did not contest below, or on appeal. We agree with the district court's conclusion: no reasonable juror could find that Telian and all but one of his comparators were similarly situated. While Telian argues that whether a person is similarly situated is a question for the jury, a court ""may grant summary judgment in a defendant's favor on the basis of lack of similarity of situation . . . where no reasonable jury could find that the persons to whom the plaintiff compares itself are similarly situated,"" as occurs here. Id. As to the one similarly situated individual, Sherri Telian, the Town did not treat her differently from Ernie Telian: the Town charged her with violations of the building code, brought her case to trial, and sought a conviction in her case. No reasonable juror could conclude that under these circumstances, the Town defendants treated Sherri and Ernie Telian differently.
3. The district court dismissed Telian's conspiracy claim because the underlying malicious prosecution and equal protection claims were also dismissed. Telian's only argument on appeal is that if we reverse either his malicious prosecution or equal protection claims, we must also reinstate his conspiracy claim. Since we affirm the district court as to both of Telian's substantive claims, we affirm the dismissal of the conspiracy claim as well.
Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.
[1]  Counsel for appellant characterized the malicious prosecution claim as a ""Due Process Claim"" in Telian's opening brief, but requests that the Court ignore the error and evaluate the claim as one for malicious prosecution. Because defendants treated the claim as one for malicious prosecution in their briefs, there is no prejudice in treating the claim as one for malicious prosecution on appeal. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346-47 (2014).
[2]  Telian, while acknowledging that no precedent in this Circuit aids his argument, urges the Court to follow the lead of two Connecticut State Trial Courts whose decisions he argues support the conclusion that withdrawals of appeals pursuant to a stipulation with the accused constitutes favorable termination. We instead rely on precedent in this Court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the June 12, 2017 judgment[1] of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.
Plaintiff-appellant Nance M. Hutter (""Plaintiff"" or ""Hutter"") and appellant Stephen A. Katz (""Katz""), an attorney proceeding pro se, appeal from the June 12, 2017 judgment of the District Court. As relevant here, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Countrywide Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of Countrywide Financial Corporation (""Countywide""), and imposed a $100 sanction on Hutter under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. The District Court also imposed a $25,000 Rule 11 sanction on Katz, Hutter's former counsel, for bringing frivolous claims and failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into pleaded facts. On appeal, Hutter challenges the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Countrywide, and Hutter and Katz both challenge the order imposing Rule 11 sanctions.
Upon review, we conclude that Hutter's arguments are without merit. We further conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning Katz, except to the extent it sanctioned Katz for pleading that Countrywide violated N.Y. Banking Law Section 598. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the sanction order against Katz and remand the cause to the District Court to recalculate the amount of the sanctions against Katz, eliminating Countrywide's costs for opposing the N.Y. Banking Law Section 598 claim. We otherwise affirm the judgment. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
* * *
In December 2006, Plaintiff Hutter refinanced her home in Bedford, New York, with a $1.785 million ""pay option adjustable-rate mortgage loan"" from Countrywide. In October 2009, Hutter brought this action against Countrywide, two mortgage brokers, and several individuals. She alleged claims under, inter alia, the Truth in Lending Act (""TILA""), 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act (""RESPA""), 12 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and New York's Deceptive Practices Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. (""GBL"") § 349 et seq., and sought, inter alia, rescission of the loan and damages. Over the course of almost five years, Hutter amended her complaint three times. After the close of discovery, she moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint that, inter alia, changed core factual allegations and added a new claim under N.Y. Banking Law Section 598.
The District Court (1) denied leave, (2) sanctioned Hutter under Rule 11(b)(3) for willfully making allegations without evidentiary support, and (3) sanctioned Katz under Rule 11(b)(2)-(3) for bringing a frivolous claim under Section 598, proposing a frivolous amendment to the Deceptive Practices Act claim, and failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into various facts alleged. The District Court ordered Hutter to pay $100 and Katz to pay Countrywide's costs of opposing the motion for leave to amend, which was $25,000. The District Court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of Countrywide on all Hutter's claims against it. This appeal followed.
* * *
We review de novo the award of summary judgment, ""constru[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the [non-moving party]"" and ""drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in [its] favor."" Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 22 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""To defeat a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, and may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation."" FDIC v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 607 F.3d 288, 292 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review a District Court's decision to impose sanctions under Rule 11 for abuse of discretion. Gollomp v. Spitzer, 568 F.3d 355, 368 (2d Cir. 2009). ""A district court `abuses' or `exceeds' the discretion accorded to it when (1) its decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision—though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding—cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir. 2001).
We can quickly dispose of Hutter's claims against Countrywide. Hutter identifies nothing in the record—other than her conclusory and often-shifting testimony and that of her husband—that supports her TILA and GBL claims. This is insufficient to defeat Countrywide's motion for summary judgment, which was supported by substantial evidence. See, e.g., App'x at 1110-11, 1122, see also Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 452 (2d Cir. 1999) (stating that testimony that is ""devoid of any specifics, but replete with conclusions, [is] insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment""). Hutter's challenge to the grant of summary judgment on her RESPA claim likewise fails because the RESPA anti-kickback provision does not apply where payments are made for ""services actually performed,"" 12 U.S.C. § 2607(b), and Hutter admitted that the broker performed services for Countrywide, App'x at 1439. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Countrywide for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its September 14, 2015 opinion and order. See Special App'x at 51-73.
The Rule 11 sanctions are more complicated. Upon review, we conclude as follows:
Rule 11(b)(3) Sanctions Against Hutter and Katz. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed the Rule 11(b)(3) sanctions, for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its August 22, 2014 memorandum opinion and order. Special App'x at 34-38, 42-45. It is remarkable, to say the least, that almost five years into the litigation Hutter and Katz still had not settled on basic facts that were easily accessible to Hutter—such as whether she was encouraged to obtain a fixed- or variable-rate interest loan.
Rule 11(b)(2) Sanction Against Katz for Seeking to Extend N.Y. Banking Law Section 598. We conclude that the District Court erred when it sanctioned Katz under Rule 11(b)(2) for seeking to extend N.Y. Banking Law Section 598. While the District Court correctly found that the statute contains no implied private right of action for conducting business with an unlicensed broker, see N.Y. Banking Law § 598(3), (5) (granting limited private cause of action only in circumstances not applicable here); Special App'x at 21-22, Katz's position to the contrary was ""not so untenable as a matter of law as to necessitate sanction."" Salovaara v. Eckert, 222 F.3d 19, 34 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The award of fees here would risk deterring others from advancing novel theories ""in good faith for fear that they would be saddled with their adversary's fees in addition to their own in the event that they failed to prevail."" Id. at 31. We therefore vacate the District Court's Rule 11(b)(2) sanction against Katz for bringing the claim under Section 598 of New York Banking Law.
Other Rule 11(b)(2) Sanction Against Katz. We affirm the remaining Rule 11(b)(2) sanction against Katz for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its August 22, 2014 memorandum opinion and order. See Special App'x at 40-41.
In sum, we affirm the District Court's August 22, 2014 order imposing Rule 11 sanctions against Hutter and Katz, except we vacate that portion of the order, see Special App'x at 38-39, imposing sanctions against Katz for arguing that there is an implied private right of action under N.Y. Banking Law Section 598 beyond those expressly granted in the statute. We remand the cause to the District Court with instructions to recalculate the amount of the sanctions against Katz, eliminating only the costs Countrywide incurred in opposing the N.Y. Banking Law Section 598 claim.
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Hutter and Katz on appeal. We find all of Hutter's arguments to be without merit. We also find all of Katz's arguments to be without merit, except his argument that the District Court erred or ""abused its discretion"" in sanctioning him under Rule 11(b)(2) for seeking to extend N.Y. Banking Law Section 598.
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the June 12, 2017 judgment of the District Court, except to the extent that we VACATE the imposition of Rule 11(b)(2) sanctions against Katz for seeking to extend N.Y. Banking Law Section 598, and REMAND the cause to the District Court with instructions to recalculate the amount of the sanctions against Katz, eliminating only the costs Countrywide incurred in opposing the N.Y. Banking Law Section 598 claim.

[*]   Judge Guido Calabresi, originally assigned to the panel, recused himself from consideration of this matter. The two remaining members of the panel, who are in agreement, have decided this case in accordance with Second Circuit Internal Operating Procedure E(b). See 28 U.S.C. § 46(d); cf. United States v.

[1]  The District Court entered what it evidently intended to be a final order on January 13, 2017. No separate document setting out judgment was issued. Accordingly, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(c)(2)(B), judgment is deemed entered 150 days from entry of the January 13, 2017 order, which is June 12, 2017. Despite the lack of a formal entry of judgment, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal noticed on February 7, 2017, as the January 13, 2017 order constituted a ""final decision"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED with respect to Anderson's principal sentence of 84 months in prison and VACATED AND REMANDED for the limited purpose of re-sentencing on the term of supervised release.
Kwame Anderson appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sentencing him principally to 84 months' incarceration and five years' supervised release following his plea of guilty to the use of a firearm during and in relation to a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Anderson was arrested in 2013 for his involvement in the Burnside Money Getters (""BMG""), a criminal drug gang in the Bronx. A wiretap investigation revealed that Anderson had acquired firearms for violent disputes and participated in multiple shootings. Anderson was charged in Superseding Indictment S2 with one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and one count of using, possessing, carrying, brandishing, and discharging firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, a racketeering conspiracy involving the BMG. On May 8, 2014, Anderson consented to the filing of Superseding Information S5, and pled guilty before Magistrate Judge Netburn to the sole count of brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). The district court accepted the plea on May 14, 2014.
Six months later, Anderson moved to withdraw his plea under Rule 11. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B). He contended that his plea was not knowing and voluntary chiefly because he was allegedly given misleading information by counsel. He also stated that he was innocent of the charge. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Anderson to the mandatory minimum sentence and a five year term of supervised release. We review a denial of a motion for plea withdrawal for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Torres, 129 F.3d 710, 714-15 (2d Cir. 1997).
A district court has discretion to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea if ""the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B). There is no right to withdraw an accepted plea, and ""[t]he defendant has the burden of demonstrating valid grounds for withdrawal."" United States v. Gonzalez, 647 F.3d 41, 56 (2d Cir. 2011). A guilty plea may be revisited if ""the defendant has raised a significant question about the voluntariness of the original plea."" United States v. Schmidt, 373 F.3d 100, 103 (2d Cir. 2004) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wilson v. McGinnis, 413 F.3d 196, 199 (2d Cir. 2005)(""[A] guilty plea violates due process and is therefore invalid if not entered voluntarily and intelligently.""). However, ""bald statements that simply contradict what [the defendant] said at his plea allocution are not sufficient grounds to withdraw [a] guilty plea."" Torres, 129 F.3d at 715. In evaluating withdrawal, courts must balance the defendant's proffered reasons against the strong interest in the ""finality of guilty pleas and the presumption that sworn statements made in open court are true."" Gonzalez, 647 F.3d at 57.
Anderson contends that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because Magistrate Judge Netburn did not make an express finding that the plea was ""knowing and voluntary"" at the plea allocution. He suggests that the court could not have done so because it was clear from contradictory statements during the plea colloquy that Anderson was confused about the nature of the charged criminal activity and did not understand the written statement prepared by his attorney.
The court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Anderson's plea was voluntary and intelligent. The magistrate judge's choice to formulate her findings without that particular phrase is of no moment; courts have flexibility in how they accept a plea and may do so in their ""own words."" United States v. Maher, 108 F.3d 1513, 1521 (2d Cir. 1997); see also McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 n. 20 (1969) (In Rule 11 inquiries, ""matters of reality, and not mere ritual, should be controlling.""). Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding no impropriety in Anderson using a prepared script at his plea hearing, particularly where Anderson stated under oath that the document was ""true and complete"" and that he ""agree[d] with everything that [he] . . . read."" J. App'x at 258; see, e.g., Ramos v. United States, 2010 WL 4922521, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2010).
""What is essential, however, is that the court determine by some means that the defendant actually understands the nature of the charges."" Maher, 108 F.3d at 1521. The magistrate judge adhered to all Rule 11 requirements for a plea colloquy, advising Anderson of his ""right to plead not guilty, the rights waived by pleading guilty, and other specific consequences of pleading guilty, such as the maximum penalties he face[d]."" United States v. Youngs, 687 F.3d 56, 59 (2d Cir. 2012); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b); J. App'x at 247-53. Moreover, notwithstanding any initial confusion over the phrase ""agreement,"" Anderson unequivocally admitted to committing each element of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), both by his own words and in his sworn prepared statement to the court. J. App'x at 256, 258.
Nor did the district court err in rejecting Anderson's claim of ""actual innocence."" Anderson contends on appeal that he could not have brandished a gun or participated in criminal activity on the day specified in his plea allocution, because he was still incarcerated. But it is undisputed that Anderson was released on February 8, 2010 in the early afternoon, and he offers no concrete accounting for the time of the events in question. Anderson's bare assertions, which contradict his ""self-inculpatory statements made under oath at his plea allocution,"" do not establish his innocence and are insufficient to justify withdrawal of his guilty plea. Adames v. United States, 171 F.3d 728, 732 (2d Cir. 1999); see also United States v. Hirsch, 239 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. 2001).
Anderson also argues that he should be able to withdraw his plea in consideration of the ineffective assistance of his counsel at the plea hearing. He claims that his counsel failed to ensure he understood the charge, and misrepresented his chances if he proceeded to trial. These allegations are contradicted by the plea agreement, PSR, and a sworn statement submitted by his former counsel, all of which show that the appellant was fully informed, and that he understood each aspect of his guilty plea.
In any event, Anderson fails to show how any error in counseling or ineffective assistance resulted in prejudice that would support withdrawal of his guilty plea. As to the particulars of the charge, the magistrate judge addressed the issues that Anderson contends his lawyer failed to explain. See Maher, 108 F.3d at 1520-21 (explaining adhere to Rule 11 for plea colloquy helps to ensure that plea is knowing and voluntary); see also Londono v. United States, No. 11 CV. 6773 CM, 2012 WL 2376456, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2012)(ineffective assistance of counsel null where the court provided the defendant with the necessary information at plea hearing). And Anderson cannot fault counsel for failing to object to the acceptance of the plea, given that the procedure of the plea hearing was not deficient and attorneys cannot be required to lodge meritless objections. See United States v. Arena, 180 F.3d 380, 396 (2d Cir. 1999), abrogation on unrelated grounds recognized by United States v. Sekhar, 683 F.3d 436 (2d Cir. 2012).
As to Anderson's ineffective assistance claim citing his substitute attorney, Mr. Dinnerstein, we consider the record incomplete to resolve the question on the merits and therefore decline to hear the claim on this appeal. See United States v. Morris, 350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir. 2003); Ellerby v. United States, 187 F.3d 257, 259-60 (2d Cir. 1998). Anderson may, of course, raise his ineffectiveness claim as a motion for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504-05 (2003)(noting that ""in most cases a motion brought under § 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance"").
Lastly, the parties agree that Anderson is entitled to a limited remand on the issue of his term of supervised release.
We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court with respect to Anderson's principal sentence of 84 months in prison and REMAND for the district court to resentence only on the supervised release component of his sentence.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Emmanuel Mfon appeals the decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Karas, J.) granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees County of Dutchess and Dutchess County Sheriff's Department and striking Mfon's supplemental expert affidavit. Mfon claims that defendants are responsible for injuries he sustained when he was struck by a driver who was fleeing from police officers. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, as well as the issues on appeal. ""We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, `resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.'"" Nick's Garage, Inc. v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 875 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir. 2017) (alterations omitted) (quoting Johnson v. Killian, 680 F.3d 234, 236 (2d Cir. 2012) (per curiam)). We review the exclusion of a supplemental expert report for abuse of discretion. See Patterson v. Balsamico, 440 F.3d 104, 117 (2d Cir. 2006).
Mfon first argues that the district court erred in holding that police officers employed by the defendants were, as a matter of law, not reckless in their pursuit of the fleeing driver. Under New York law, the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle is exempted from certain traffic laws during ""an emergency operation,"" but is not ""protected . . . from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others."" N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1104(a), (e). Under this statute, ""a police officer's conduct in pursuing a suspected lawbreaker may not form the basis of civil liability to an injured bystander unless the officer acted in reckless disregard for the safety of others."" Saarinen v. Kerr, 84 N.Y.2d 494, 501 (1994). This standard ""requires evidence that `the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character in disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow' and has done so with conscious indifference to the outcome."" Id. (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 34 (5th ed. 1984)).
The evidence, with all factual ambiguities resolved in Mfon's favor, shows Jonathan Besze fled from one or more police officers for approximately nine miles over a ten-minute period, for an average speed of 54 miles per hour. Mfon v. County of Dutchess, No. 14-cv-6922 (KMK), 2017 WL 946303, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2017). The chase took place after midnight, in clear weather, and on dry roads. Id. During the chase, Besze illegally passed other vehicles, ran five red lights, and, on one occasion, drove the wrong way around a traffic circle. A passenger in Besze's car submitted an affidavit stating that he feared for his life. The drivers encountered between 12 and 20 other cars on the road. The police officers testified, and no witness disagreed, that the drivers encountered no pedestrians. The chase ended when Besze struck Mfon's car, causing him to sustain a cerebral concussion and traumatic brain injury. Id. at *2.
We agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could conclude that the police officers were reckless, as the New York courts have defined that term, in their pursuit of Besze. See Saarinen, 84 N.Y.2d at 503 (""Officer McGown's maximum speed of 60 m.p.h. was hardly a `breakneck' pace for a police pursuit on relatively empty, nonresidential streets.""); see also, e.g., Rodriguez v. City of New York, 105 A.D.3d 623, 624-25 (1st Dep't 2013) (immunizing police officers who ""pursu[ed] [a fleeing driver] on icy and slippery roadways"" through two red lights); Gonzalez v. Zavala, 88 A.D.3d 946, 947-48 (2d Dep't 2011) (immunizing a police officer who pursued a fleeing driver for two miles at speeds up to 70 miles per hour, where the driver ran nine red lights and swerved through traffic). Although Mfon's injuries are unfortunate, they were caused not by police recklessness, but by Besze's unlawful attempts to evade the authorities.
Mfon resists this conclusion by pointing to evidence purportedly showing that traffic conditions on the chase route were busier than recounted above, such as a traffic camera video of the intersection where the collision occurred and a video of a driver retracing the chase route two years later. At best, this evidence only creates ""some metaphysical doubt"" about traffic conditions on the night of the chase and is insufficient to survive summary judgment. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). Mfon also stresses that the chase was unusually long and that the officers failed to keep a supervisor fully apprised of the facts of chase, but these factors do not raise a triable issue of fact on recklessness where the chase took place late at night over dry, quiet streets and at moderate speeds.[1]
Mfon next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding a supplemental expert affidavit for exceeding the scope of the initial expert report, which itself suffered from a number of technical errors. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) (""If a party fails to provide information . . . as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion . . . unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.""). ""In determining whether the district court acted within its discretion, this Court considers (1) the party's explanation for the failure to comply with the disclosure requirement; (2) the importance of the testimony of the precluded witnesses; (3) the prejudice suffered by the opposing party as a result of having to prepare to meet the new testimony; and (4) the possibility of a continuance."" Patterson, 440 F.3d at 117 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).
The excluded affidavit was more detailed than the initial report, including in its reliance on the ""red mist"" theory and in its criticism of the officers' failure to tell a supervisor that Besze may have been intoxicated. As the district court pointed out, Mfon made ""no attempt to amend the [initial expert report], justify or assert the harmlessness of the omissions [from the initial report], or even address Defendants' arguments regarding the failure to comply with Rule 26."" Mfon, 2017 WL 946303, at *5. Mfon does little better on appeal, where he relies mainly on district court decisions resolving Rule 37 questions in the first instance. See, e.g., Cedar Petrochemicals, Inc. v. Dongbu Hannong Chem. Co., 769 F. Supp. 2d 269, 279 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Although these decisions suggest that another district court might have allowed the affidavit, they tell us little about whether the district court was permitted to exclude it. Weighing the Patterson factors, we cannot conclude that excluding the affidavit was an abuse of discretion.
We have considered all of the parties' remaining arguments and have found in them no basis for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
[1]  Contrary to Mfon's argument, his retrograde amnesia does not entitle him to a reduced burden of proof on his personal injury claim. See Noseworthy v. City of New York, 298 N.Y. 76, 80 (1948) (""[I]n a death case such as this, the plaintiff is not held to the high degree of proof required in a case where the injured person may take the stand and give his version of the happening of the accident."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We will assume arguendo that this common-law rule applies to the question of whether defendants are entitled to a limited statutory immunity. Mfon nevertheless falls outside the rule because he was not a witness to the car chase and cannot be expected to have any evidence about whether the pursuit was reckless. In other words, with or without amnesia, Mfon could not ""describe the occurrence that produced his injury."" Schechter v. Klanfer, 28 N.Y.2d 228, 232 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Petitioner-appellant Orange Rodgers appeals from an April 19, 2016 judgment, and a June 15, 2016 order, of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York denying his motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate his sentence, imposed in accordance with a binding plea agreement, for possession by a convicted felon of a firearm that had been shipped and transported in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Rodgers argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion because: (1) he did not waive his right to bring a § 2255 motion since the district court failed, in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N), to state in the plea colloquy that the sentence could not be collaterally attacked, and (2) the required predicate offenses for enhanced sentencing under the Armed Criminal Career Act are now lacking by virtue of Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. Rodgers' plea agreement waived any collateral attack on his sentence. He argues that the waiver should not be enforced because, at the colloquy in his change of plea hearing, the court stated that Rodgers was waiving his right to appeal his sentence without stating that he was also waiving his right to bring a challenge under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. According to Rodgers, the district court's violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N) means that his guilty plea was not knowing; rather, he thought he retained his right to collaterally challenge his sentence.
Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 is ""designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant's guilty plea is truly voluntary."" United States v. Maher, 108 F.3d 1513, 1520 (2d Cir. 1997). ""[T]his Circuit has adopted a standard of strict adherence to Rule 11,"" so ""we examine critically even slight procedural deficiencies to ensure that the defendant's guilty plea was a voluntary and intelligent choice, and that none of the defendant's substantial rights has been compromised."" United States v. Livorsi, 180 F.3d 76, 78 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted). However, unless there is an objection to a flaw in the plea colloquy, ""strict adherence"" to Rule 11 is subject to plain error review, which ""does not frequently require vacatur of a plea."" United States v. Pattee, 820 F.3d 496, 503 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 222 (2016); see also id. at 505 (stating that plain error review requires a defendant to demonstrate (1) error, (2) that was plain, (3) that ""prejudicially affected his substantial rights, and (4) ""seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Rodgers' substantial rights were not affected. First, the written plea agreement, which Rodgers read and signed knowingly and voluntarily, with the assistance of his counsel, contains an express waiver of collateral attack. Second, Rodgers averred at the change of plea hearing that he had sufficient time to discuss the case with his counsel, was satisfied with his representation, had no questions about the proceedings, and entered the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily. The district court then determined that Rodgers understood that he was waiving his right to appeal his sentence, and asked him if he ""underst[ood] that you may not appeal your sentence if I sentence you to 120 months or less,"" to which Rodgers responded, ""[y]es, your Honor."" Joint App'x at 40.
Based on these facts, the failure to orally note the collateral attack bar in his plea agreement at the change of plea hearing is not clear error, and does not invalidate that bar. See Sanford v. United States, 841 F.3d 578, 581 (2d Cir. 2016) (although the district court ""did not specifically mention that [the defendant] had waived the right to `otherwise challenge' the conviction or sentence (i.e., collaterally attack them)[,] [g]iven [the defedant's] sworn statement that he had talked with his lawyer about the plea agreement and signed it, and there being no evidence indicating that [the defendant] was coerced or misunderstood any of the relevant facts, we conclude that he knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the collateral attack waiver.""); Tellado v. United States, 745 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2014) (""We conclude, therefore, that the district court's omission of the phrase `collateral attack' in its own explanation of the rights [the defendant] was relinquishing does not, under these facts, constitute plain error."" (emphasis in original)).
2. At the time of sentencing, Rodgers had three prior violent felony convictions, which made him subject to a 15-year minimum sentence as an Armed Career Criminal, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Rodgers argues that, under Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), which invalidated the ""residual clause"" of the Armed Career Criminal Act's definition of ""violent felony"" as void for vagueness, his prior conviction for Attempt to Commit Robbery in the Second Degree, N.Y. Penal Law § 160.10, is no longer a violent felony for the purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. Rodgers sought resentencing on the ground that the two remaining prior violent felonies would not subject him to the 15-year mandatory minimum if he were sentenced today. Since, Rodgers continues, he entered into his plea agreement only to escape the then-applicable 15-year mandatory minimum (which would no longer apply to him) the Court should find that his acceptance of a plea agreement does not preclude resentencing.
The government argues that Attempt to Commit Robbery in the Second Degree, N.Y. Penal Law § 160.10, remains a violent felony notwithstanding Johnson. But we need not reach this issue. Rodgers' motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is barred by his plea waiver. ""While plea agreements are to be applied narrowly and construed strictly against the government, exceptions to the presumption of the enforceability of a waiver . . . occupy a very circumscribed area of our jurisprudence."" Sanford, 841 F.3d at 580 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). ""Even assuming, however, that [a defendant] was sentenced under a Guidelines provision that is unconstitutional after Johnson, this Court has held that a defendant's inability to foresee a change in the law does not supply a basis for failing to enforce an appeal waiver. On the contrary, the possibility of a favorable change in the law after a plea is simply one of the risks that accompanies pleas and plea agreements."" Id., 841 F.3d at 580 (internal citations, alteration, and quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Lee, 523 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v. Morgan, 406 F.3d 135, 137 (2d Cir. 2005). We have ""upheld waiver provisions even in circumstances where the sentence was conceivably imposed in an illegal fashion or in violation of the Guidelines, but yet was still within the range contemplated in the plea agreement."" Sanford, 841 F.3d at 580 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part.
Appellant Louis Gachette, proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court's December 21, 2016 order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants Metro North-High Bridge (""Metro-North"") and Preston Kirk. Gachette sued his former employer, Metro-North, and his supervisor, Kirk, under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the New York State Human Rights Law (""NYSHRL""), N.Y. Exec. Law § 290 et seq., and the New York City Human Rights Law (""NYCHRL""), N.Y. City Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq., for employment discrimination on theories of disparate treatment and retaliation. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment as to Gachette's claims de novo, construing all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable inferences against the moving party at the summary judgment stage. Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 434 (2d Cir. 2015). We ""may affirm on any basis that finds support in the record."" Id. Summary judgment is appropriate if ""there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
I. Disparate Treatment Claims Against Metro-North Under § 1981, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL
At the start, we conclude that vacatur is appropriate as to Gachette's claims of disparate treatment by Metro-North under § 1981, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL, so that the district court may, in the first instance, address the merits of whether Gachette's motion to compel the production of overtime records should be granted. Gachette claims that Metro-North gave him less overtime pay because he identifies as ""black African or Afro-American."" Record on Appeal (""ROA"") doc. 25-1, at 36:4-6. The record suggests that Gachette attempted to gather proof of this allegation by serving Metro-North with a request for overtime records on May 21, 2013. When Metro-North failed to respond to Gachette's discovery request, Gachette repeatedly notified both Metro-North and the district court of Metro-North's non-compliance by filing letters with the district court on June 28, 2013, July 19, 2013, and October 24, 2013. The district court construed Gachette's October 24, 2013 letter as a motion to compel and summarily denied the motion on October 25, 2013, reasoning that discovery closed on May 31, 2013 and that defendants had already filed for summary judgment on July 12, 2013.
We disagree with the district court's summary denial of Gachette's motion to compel. The record shows that Metro-North represented to the district court in a letter dated June 19, 2013 that it was searching for overtime records and needed extra time (until July 12, 2013) to complete its search. After oral argument, we ordered Metro-North to show cause why it did not respond to Gachette's May 21, 2013 request. In its response to our order, Metro-North (1) did not dispute that Gachette served Metro-North with a discovery request for overtime records on May 21, 2013 and that Metro-North failed to respond; and (2) neglected to explain why Metro-North did not produce those records after representing to the district court that a three-week deadline extension from June 21, 2013 until July 12, 2013 was required to give Metro-North sufficient time to gather overtime records ""in order to rebut plaintiff's allegation"" that Metro-North ""assign[ed] white electricians to work more overtime than black electricians."" ROA doc. 19; see also No. 17-209-cv, doc. 77.
Based on such a record, and pursuant to the ""special solicitude [that] should be afforded pro se litigants generally, when confronted with motions for summary judgment,"" we cannot conclude that Gachette's request for overtime records was untimely. Graham v. Lewinski, 848 F.2d 342, 344 (2d Cir. 1988); cf. Lucas v. Miles, 84 F.3d 532, 535 (2d Cir. 1996) (""[D]istrict courts should be especially hesitant to dismiss for procedural deficiencies where, as here, the failure is by a pro se litigant.""). And although Metro-North now argues that Gachette's ""request is wholly speculative and overbroad,"" No. 17-209-cv, doc. 77, at 8, the district court has not yet had the opportunity to reach the merits of this discovery dispute in the first instance. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1); see also Compagnie Francaise d'Assurance Pour le Commerce Exterieur v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 105 F.R.D. 16, 42 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (observing that the objecting party bears the ""burden . . . [to] show specifically how, despite the broad and liberal construction afforded the federal discovery rules, each [discovery request] is not relevant or how each question is overly broad, burdensome or oppressive . . . by submitting affidavits or offering evidence revealing the nature of the burden."" (citations omitted)).
The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants was premature without first resolving this discovery dispute. In its opinion granting summary judgment, the district court specifically observed that ""[a]lthough [Gachette] believes he received as little as half the overtime of white electricians, he concedes that he does not have proof other than `common sense' and his own complaint."" ROA doc. 52, at 5. Metro-North itself represented to the district court that its overtime records are relevant to proving Gachette's claims, but then failed to produce those records. These overtime records could very well create a disputed issue of material fact and preclude summary judgment. See Tolbert, 790 F.3d at 434. Therefore, we vacate and remand the portion of the district court's opinion which granted summary judgment to Metro-North on Gachette's disparate treatment claims pursuant to § 1981, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. See, e.g., Boomer v. Goord, 283 F. App'x 855, 858 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order) (vacating and remanding ""in an abundance of caution"" for district court to reconsider whether to grant summary judgment in light of pro se plaintiff's representations, undisputed by defendant, that defendant failed to respond to his discovery request).
II. Retaliation Claims Against Kirk Under § 1981 and NYSHRL
We affirm as to the district court's holding that Gachette failed to establish a prima facie case against Kirk for retaliation. Metro-North terminated Gachette when he refused to take a drug test. Gachette argues that Kirk administered the drug test and terminated him as retaliation for his complaints about discriminatory treatment. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under § 1981 and NYSHRL, ""a plaintiff must adduce evidence sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find (1) that []he engaged in protected activity under the anti-discrimination statutes, (2) that the employer was aware of this activity, (3) that the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (4) that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action, i.e., that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action."" Fincher v. Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 720 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). To establish individual liability, ""a plaintiff must demonstrate some affirmative link to causally connect the actor with the discriminatory action."" Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., 223 F.3d 62, 75 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Vivenzio v. City of Syracuse, 611 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 2010) (same standards for Title VII, § 1981, and NYSHRL).
First, Gachette failed to establish the second element of his prima facie case because he presented no evidence that Kirk knew about his overtime complaints: Gachette sent letters complaining about overtime assignments directly to the President of Metro-North on June 7, 2010 and September 17, 2010, but he testified that he never provided copies of those letters to Kirk. Gachette also testified that he never made any direct complaints to Kirk; he merely assumed that Kirk would know of the letters that he sent to the President of Metro-North. Gachette's retaliation claims thus fail because if Kirk did not know that Gachette was complaining about overtime assignments, then there was no way that Kirk could take any retaliatory action based on Gachette's complaints.
Furthermore, even if Gachette could establish that Kirk knew about his overtime complaints, Gachette cannot establish the fourth element of his prima facie case because the gap between his complaints and his ultimate dismissal undermines any inference of a causal connection. Gachette was randomly selected for a drug test and removed from service on July 26, 2011, and his dismissal was effective on August 31, 2011. Gachette's dismissal thus occurred nearly one year after he sent his last letter of complaint on September 17, 2010. See Gorman Bakos v. Cornell Co-op Extension of Schenectady Cty., 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001) (collecting cases holding three-month, four-month, and one-year gaps to be too long to suggest a causal relationship). Gachette's argument that it is ""undisputable that [he] was let go because of the EEOC charge against Metro-North and its agents,"" moreover, is to no avail: Gachette filed the EEOC charge after he was fired. Pl.-Appellant Br. 14; see also ROA doc. 11.
Hence, Gachette's retaliation claims against Kirk under § 1981 and NYSHRL cannot survive Metro-North's motion for summary judgment.
III. Retaliation Claims Against Kirk Under NYCHRL
Even under the NYCHRL's ""broadly interpreted"" standard of liability, Gachette's retaliation claim against Kirk must fail. Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 112 (2d Cir. 2013). To prevail under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff ""must show that [he] took an action opposing [his] employer's discrimination and that, as a result, the employer engaged in conduct that was reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in such action."" Id. (internal citations omitted). The NYCHRL thus requires Gachette to show a causal link between his overtime complaints and Kirk's allegedly retaliatory actions, which as discussed above, Gachette is unable to do.
IV. Age Discrimination and Employment Act (""ADEA"") and Equal Pay Act (""EPA"") Claims
Finally, Gachette briefly refers to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act and the Equal Pay Act, violations of which were not asserted in his complaint. Although Gachette raised these claims in opposition to summary judgment, the district court did not have to reach those claims. See Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing IIT v. Cornfeld, 619 F.2d 909, 914 n.6 (2d Cir. 1980) for proposition that ""a party is not entitled to amend its complaint through statements made in motion papers"").
We have considered the parties' remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment as to Gachette's retaliation, ADEA, and EPA claims, and we VACATE and REMAND as to Gachette's disparate treatment claims for further proceedings consistent with this order.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the appeals are DISMISSED.
Janon Fisher appeals from an order of the District Court (Abrams, J.) denying his motion to unseal all proceedings and court records regarding any criminal prosecution of Jona Rechnitz. DNAinfo appeals from an order of the District Court (Stein, J.) denying its motion to unseal the same records. On December 12, 2016, we consolidated the appeals of Fisher and DNAinfo (collectively, ""Appellants""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to dismiss these consolidated appeals as moot.
A case becomes moot, at any stage of litigation, when there is no longer a live case or controversy for a court to decide, such as when the plaintiff has already received the relief sought. See U.S. Const. art. III; Liner v. Jafco, Inc., 375 U.S. 301, 306 & n.3 (1964). A narrow exception to the mootness doctrine arises where the underlying dispute between the parties is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" Neb. Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 546 (1976), that is, when ""(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again,"" Granato v. Bane, 74 F.3d 406, 411 (2d Cir. 1996) (quotation marks omitted).
Here, the Appellants have already received their requested relief in the form of fully unsealed and unredacted documents. As a result, the Government argues, the case is now moot. The question before us is whether the case nevertheless continues to be a live controversy because it is capable of repetition, yet evading review. S. Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911).
We have previously held that the full disclosure of a plea or cooperation agreement does not necessarily moot an appeal. United States v. Haller, 837 F.2d 84, 86 (2d Cir. 1988). In Haller, we concluded that it reasonably could be assumed that the journalistic party seeking disclosure of the sealed plea documents in that case would be subjected to another, similar sealing order in the future. Id. But the timeframe in Haller was compressed: about nine weeks elapsed between the request to unseal the documents and the Government's complete unsealing of those records. Id. By contrast, a full nine months elapsed between Fisher's June 2016 request to unseal and the Government's partial unsealing in March 2017, and about seventeen months elapsed between that request and the Government's complete unsealing in November 2017. At oral argument, counsel for Appellants insisted that the ""period of sealing was too short for full appellate review,"" but counsel also conceded that our inquiry to determine whether that is so—that is, whether the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation—is ultimately a ""fact-specific"" one. Oral Argument at 45:33.
We discern no significant obstacles to the Appellants' seeking and obtaining appellate review of the sealing decisions well within either the nine- or seventeen-month period. See In re Kurtzman, 194 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (""focus[ing] on the order at issue"" to determine ""whether the elapsed time that gave rise to mootness"" necessarily ""limit[ed] judicial review"" (quotation marks omitted)). To the contrary, Appellants could have acted to expedite the appellate process in this case, but failed to do so. Mootness was the result of their failure to act, rather than the nature of the case. For these reasons, on this record and under the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude that the challenged action was not so short as to evade review or to have ""inevitably. . . lapse[d] into mootness prior to review."" Id.
We have considered Appellants' remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the appeals are DISMISSED as moot.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Appellant Phyllis Gottlieb (""Gottlieb"") appeals from the district court's judgment dismissing her civil suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and First American Title Insurance Company (""First American""). In 2003, the SEC obtained a securities fraud judgment against Gottlieb's husband, Allen, for over $2 million. See SEC v. Stewart, No. 98-cv-2636(LAP) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2003). To date, Allen Gottlieb has made no voluntary payments towards satisfying the judgment, and the SEC has attempted to collect on the judgment from his assets. While the judgment against Allen Gottlieb was outstanding, Phyllis Gottlieb sold a family home in Florida, and First American held the proceeds. After ascertaining that Allen Gottlieb was the true owner of the home, the SEC sought turnover of the funds. In response, Phyllis Gottlieb filed the suit at issue here in Florida state court, seeking to obtain the funds from the home sale. The action was removed to the Southern District of Florida, and then transferred to the Southern District of New York. In the Southern District, Gottlieb failed to comply with three court orders to appear for a deposition in Miami. The SEC moved for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, and Gottlieb, through counsel, agreed that dismissal of the suit was an appropriate remedy. Gottlieb now appeals from that dismissal. She argues on appeal that the district courts erred by transferring and later dismissing her suit, and that Judge Preska was biased. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review venue transfer decisions and the imposition of Rule 37 sanctions for abuse of discretion. Agiwal v. Mid Island Mortg. Corp., 555 F.3d 298, 302 (2d Cir. 2009) (Rule 37 sanctions); D.H. Blair & Co., Inc. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 105 (2d Cir. 2006) (venue transfer). Upon review, we conclude that the district courts properly transferred the action to the Southern District of New York, and dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 37.
A district court may, ""[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,"" transfer a civil action to any district where it might have been brought. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). District courts possess broad discretion under § 1404(a), and consider factors such as:
(1) the plaintiff02b9s choice of forum, (2) the convenience of witnesses, (3) the location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof, (4) the convenience of parties, (5) the locus of operative facts, (6) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses, [and] (7) the relative means of the parties.
D.H. Blair & Co., Inc., 462 F.3d at 106-07 (alteration in original). Here, the New York forum was more convenient for the SEC; First American did not object; all the parties had to appear in New York in Stewart; and the convenience of the Florida forum for Gottlieb was diminished by the fact that she had moved, first to the Bahamas, and then to Brazil. Furthermore, the ""first-filed rule"" provides a presumption in favor of the Southern District of New York, where litigation over the funds from the Gottliebs' home sale was first initiated. See N. Y. Marine & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Lafarge N.A., Inc., 599 F.3d 102, 112 (2d Cir. 2010).
As to the Rule 37 sanction of dismissal, Gottlieb, through counsel, agreed that dismissal was a proper sanction. She is bound by her concession. See Gomez v. City of New York, 805 F.3d 419, 424 (2d Cir. 2015) (a client is generally bound by the acts of her attorney). The presumption that the attorney speaks for the client is rebuttable when an attorney undertakes settlement or dismissal on the client's behalf. Id. However, Gottlieb does not argue that her attorney acted without her authority when he agreed that dismissal was an appropriate remedy.
Finally, we review for plain error a district court judge's refusal to recuse herself sua sponte. United States v. Carlton, 534 F.3d 97, 100 (2d Cir. 2008). A judge must recuse from ""any proceeding in which h[er] impartiality might reasonably be questioned"" by an objective observer. SEC v. Razmilovic, 738 F.3d 14, 29 (2d Cir. 2013) (alteration in original) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 455(a)). Claims of judicial bias generally must be based on extrajudicial matters. See Chen v. Chen Qualified Settlement Fund, 552 F.3d 218, 227 (2d Cir. 2009) (""[A]dverse rulings, without more, will rarely suffice to provide a reasonable basis for questioning a judge's impartiality.""). Gottlieb's principal argument (that Judge Preska was biased because of her involvement with Stewart) does not raise any question of Judge Preska's impartiality for an objective observer. Other than dismissal of this case, Gottlieb does not suggest that Judge Preska made any statements or took any actions exhibiting bias; and the dismissal (as explained above) was clearly within Judge Preska's discretion. Gottlieb's argument that she had no opportunity to object to Judge Preska's appointment is unavailing because Gottlieb could have moved for recusal at any time and chose not to.
We have considered Gottlieb's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the February 23, 2017 judgment of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
Defendant-appellant David Eisenhart appeals from a February 23, 2017 judgment following his plea of guilty to bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344. When calculating the Sentencing Guidelines range, the District Court included, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, a two-level increase for abuse of a position of private trust. The District Court then sentenced Eisenhart to, inter alia, a year and a day in prison. On appeal, Eisenhart argues that (1) the two-level increase for abuse of a position of trust was procedurally unreasonable, and (2) the two-level increase resulted in a substantively unreasonable prison sentence. We conclude that his arguments are without merit and affirm.
BACKGROUND[1]
The parties agree that between October 2013 and June 2015 Eisenhart perpetrated two criminal schemes.[2] The schemes are as follows:
Cadillac Escalade Scheme. In October 2013, Eisenhart purchased a 2011 Cadillac Escalade with financing from a credit union. Two months later, he fraudulently refinanced the loan by lying to another credit union about the purchase price of the vehicle, and received $58,935.11. Then in April 2015, while still owing over $50,000 on the vehicle-secured loan, Eisenhart fraudulently procured a clean title from the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles by falsely reporting that the title was lost and presenting a forged document purportedly showing that the credit union had released the lien. This scheme culminated in Eisenhart selling the Escalade to a used car dealer in May 2015 and pocketing the proceeds for himself.
Wilkins Enterprises Scheme. From 2011 through March 2015, Eisenhart was a business manager at Wilkins Enterprises, Inc., a Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership. As business manager, Eisenhart was responsible for all paperwork relating to motorcycle sales. Beginning around 2013, he embezzled nearly $17,000 from customers by underreporting cash down payments. He concealed the embezzlements by altering documents such as bills of sale and warranty documents. This scheme continued through March 2015, when the accounting irregularities were discovered and Eisenhart was fired.
In December 2015, the Government filed a three-count indictment, covering both schemes. The parties ultimately reached an agreement in which Eisenhart pled guilty to bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344 for the Cadillac Escalade Scheme. In the plea agreement, Eisenhart stipulated that, if the sentencing court determined he had also committed the Wilkins Enterprises Scheme, it could consider all the resulting losses in calculating the advisory imprisonment range.
At sentencing, the District Court considered both the Cadillac Escalade and Wilkins Enterprises Schemes when calculating the Guidelines advisory range. The District Court thus included the losses from the Wilkins Enterprises Scheme when calculating a six-level specific offense characteristics increase for losses exceeding $40,000, and included a two-level increase for Eisenhart's abuse of Wilkins Enterprises' trust when defrauding its customers.
The District Court arrived at an offense level of thirteen and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a Guidelines range of twelve to eighteen months. The District Court ultimately sentenced Eisenhart to one year and one day in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered Eisenhart to pay $68,212.51 in restitution.
This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
""We review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under a `deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.'"" United States v. Thavaraja, 740 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007)). ""The procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court's compliance with its statutory obligation to consider the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), while the substantive inquiry assesses the length of the sentence imposed in light of the § 3553(a) factors."" United States v. Verkhoglyad, 516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal alterations, citations, and quotation marks omitted). Legal questions are reviewed de novo and factual determinations for clear error. United States v. Friedberg, 558 F.3d 131, 133 (2d Cir. 2009).
I. Procedural Reasonableness
Eisenhart argues that the District Court committed procedural error by applying a two-level abuse of trust enhancement. He rests his argument on a distinction between ""relevant"" conduct and ""charged"" conduct. Specifically, he admits that his conduct in both schemes was ""relevant"" to determining his specific offense characteristics and amount owed in restitution, but contends that the non-charged yet ""relevant"" conduct cannot be considered for the purposes of the abuse of trust enhancement. According to Eisenhart, this is in part because the victim of the abuse of trust must be the victim of the charged offense. We disagree.
By its plain language, the Guidelines foreclose Eisenhart's proposed distinction. Guidelines Section 3B1.3 provides that, ""[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust . . . in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 (emphasis added). ""Offense,"" in turn, is defined as ""the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under § 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). . . ."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 cmt. n.1(H) (emphasis added). And where, as here, an offense is ""of a character for which § 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts,"" ""relevant conduct"" encompasses all acts or omissions ""that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2). Guidelines Section 3B1.3 therefore prescribes abuse of trust enhancements for all ""relevant conduct,"" including all acts that were ""part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction."" Id.
Eisenhart concedes that his ""thefts from Wilkins' customers . . . [are] relevant conduct to his offense of conviction,"" and does not challenge the inclusion of the losses from those thefts in the specific offense characteristics and restitution calculations. Appellant Br. at 18. Having so conceded, Eisenhart cannot also argue that the thefts from the Wilkins Enterprises Scheme were not relevant conduct for the abuse of trust enhancement. Indeed, the Guidelines expressly reject such a distinction, specifying that the definition of ""relevant conduct"" also applies to ""adjustments in Chapter Three,"" where the abuse of trust enhancement is found. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a).
The only question remaining is whether Eisenhart, in fact, abused a position of trust when committing the Wilkins Enterprises Scheme. See United States v. Nuzzo, 385 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir. 2004). Eisenhart does not contest that he abused a position of trust when perpetrating the scheme; rather, he avers that Wilkins Enterprises is not considered a victim for the purposes of the enhancement. This argument is meritless, because the enhancement applies where the defendant abused the trust of a secondary victim of the crime. Friedberg, 558 F.3d at 135-36. Here, Wilkins Enterprises is a secondary victim, for the business suffered significant staffing disruptions and reputational damage following the discovery of Eisenhart's crime. App'x at 45.
In sum, we conclude that the District Court did not commit procedural error when it applied a two-level increase for abuse of a position of private trust pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3.
II. Substantive Reasonableness
We also conclude that Eisenhart's prison sentence of one year and one day was substantively reasonable. Not only was it at the bottom end of the advisory range, it was only one day longer than the sentence Eisenhart himself urged in his sentencing memorandum.[3] Accordingly, the sentence comfortably ""falls within the broad range that can be considered reasonable under the totality of the circumstances."" United States v. Jones, 531 F.3d 163, 174 (2d Cir. 2008).
CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Eisenhart on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the February 23, 2017 judgment of the District Court.
[1]  We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal. We refer to the background of the case only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
[2]  The parties also agree that Eisenhart perpetrated a third scheme involving a loan on a BMW motorcycle, but that scheme is not relevant for purposes of this appeal.
[3]  The extra day was added for Eisenhart's benefit. See Joint App'x at 88. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b)(1), only ""a prisoner who is serving a term of more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence"" for good behavior.

Janes (""plaintiff"" or ""Janes"") appeals from a judgment of the District Court affirming the Administrative Law Judge's (""ALJ"") denial of his application, pursuant to Title II of the Social Security Act (the ""SSA""), 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i) & 423 for disability insurance benefits. The District Court granted the motion of the Commissioner of Social Security (""defendant"" or ""Commissioner"") for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the ALJ's denial of benefits, on the ground that Janes was not disabled within the meaning of the SSA, was supported by substantial evidence. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
On June 3, 2014, plaintiff applied for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits, alleging disability beginning on April 28, 2014. Plaintiff's application was denied on August 25, 2014, after which he timely requested a hearing before an ALJ. On May 8, 2015, the ALJ issued a written decision finding plaintiff not disabled under the SSA. Plaintiff's request for review by the Appeals Council was denied, at which point he filed suit in District Court. The parties then filed cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings. The District Court denied plaintiff's motion and granted defendant's motion, finding the ALJ's decision supported by substantial evidence. This appeal followed.
""When deciding an appeal from a denial of disability benefits, we focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court's opinion."" Kohler v. Astrue, 546 F.3d 260, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2008). Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner's decision is based on legal error or her factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g); see also Cichocki v. Astrue, 729 F.3d 172, 175-76 (2d Cir. 2013). We conduct a plenary review of the record to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner's decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. Cichocki, 729 F.3d at 176. Where evidence is deemed susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, the Commissioner's conclusion must be upheld. Rutherford v. Schweiker, 685 F.2d 60, 62 (2d Cir. 1982).
Plaintiff raises two claims on appeal. He first argues that the ALJ failed to develop the factual record because the ALJ did not obtain his medical records from the Veteran's Administration for the ten months preceding the ALJ's decision. He next argues that the Commissioner committed legal error by obtaining consultative examinations from non-treating doctors, without giving him notice of his right to object to the sources to be used. Janes contends that this practice violated his due process rights. Both of these arguments are without merit.
Upon a review of the record, and substantially for the reasons set forth by the District Court, we conclude that the ALJ properly gathered and analyzed the evidence necessary to form a determination as to plaintiff's disability. The record in front of the ALJ contained (1) plaintiff's treatment records from the Veterans Administration from at least 2006 through July 31, 2014; (2) a consultative physical examination report and opinion from Tanya Perkins-Mwantuali, M.D., dated July 31, 2014; and (3) a psychiatric consultative examination report and opinion from Jacqueline Santoro, Ph.D., dated July 31, 2014. The record contained over 450 pages of plaintiff's medical history for the 8 years prior to the filing of his claim. The ALJ is not required to develop the record any further when the evidence already presented is ""adequate for [the ALJ] to make a determination as to disability."" See Perez v. Chater, 77 F.3d 41, 48 (2d Cir. 1996).
Upon a review of the record, we also conclude the Commissioner did not err in hiring non-treating consultative medical examiners to evaluate the plaintiff. The Commissioner has clear discretion to solicit the opinion of a non-treating physician. See 20 C.F.R §§ 404.1519g, h. The Commissioner retained an experienced and competent doctor associated with a practice that has a history of providing consultative examinations for the purposes of determining eligibility for disability benefits. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that plaintiff requested that he be evaluated by his treating physicians, or that he timely objected to being evaluated by other doctors.
We similarly reject plaintiff's due process challenge to the lack of notice of his right to object. ""Due process cases have long recognized that publication in the Federal Register constitutes an adequate means of informing the public of an agency action."" Perales v. Reno, 48 F.3d 1305, 1316 (2d Cir. 1995). Here, the Federal Register provided this required notice: ""You or your representative may object to your being examined by a medical source we have designated to perform a consultative examination."" 20 C.F.R. § 404.1519j.
CONCLUSION
We therefore conclude, on the basis of the whole record, that the Commissioner's finding of no disability is supported by substantial evidence. We thus AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.

CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Richard Laquer appeals from the judgment of the district court for the District of Connecticut (Arterton, J.) dismissing his Complaint under Rule 12(b)(1), for lack of prudential standing. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Priceline Group, Inc. (""Priceline"") offers a ""Name Your Own Price"" service for car reservations: customers may submit a price for a class of vehicle on a certain date, time and location, which Priceline matches to a rental car company willing to accept the offer. To obtain a reservation, customers must agree to Priceline's terms and conditions, including that the ""[r]ental cars are non-refundable, non-transferable and non-changeable even if the reservation is not used."" App'x 82. Laquer submitted a request for a rental car reservation in San Francisco on June 7, 2015 and obtained a match with Hertz; the total charge for the reservation would be $54.05 per day, including $35 for the car and a $19.05 charge for ""Taxes and Fees."" Laquer failed to pick up the car at the appointed date and time. He filed the instant action asserting claims for unjust enrichment and ""false representation"" with respect to the taxes and fees portion of the total charge on the ground that the money collected was not a tax because he never consummated the car rental.[2]
We review de novo a district court's granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Allco Finance Ltd. v. Klee, 805 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2015), accepting as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 306 (2d Cir. 2015).
Standing includes ""both constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise."" Rajamin v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., 757 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)). The ""prudential standing rule . . . normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves."" Warth, 422 U.S. at 509. ""[T]he plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties."" Id. at 499.
Laquer argues that Priceline collected taxes for the purposes of the car reservation, but that Priceline failed to remit or cause Hertz to remit those taxes to the state of California. He alleges in the Complaint and the FAC that Priceline thereby violated § 6204 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, which concerns the ""use tax"" imposed on consumers using tangible personal property in the state. Section 6204 provides that
[t]he tax required to be collected by the retailer and any amount unreturned to the customer which is not tax but was collected from the customer under the representation by the retailer that it was tax constitutes debts owed by the retailer to this state.
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6204 (emphasis added). Assuming arguendo that the amounts Laquer seek to recover was a tax that was not in fact due, those amounts constitute a debt owed to the State of California, and it is the State, not Laquer, who would be injured and entitled to recovery. Laquer's claim seeking a refund of the tax in federal court therefore violates ""the prudential standing rule that normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves."" Warth, 422 U.S. at 509. Laquer argues on appeal that the district court erred in relying on § 6204 to the exclusion of § 6901.5, which concerns ""tax reimbursement payments"" collected by retailers to offset their own sales tax payments. Even if § 6901.5 were to apply to Laquer's claim (which we do not hold), the provision does not allow Laquer to seek relief in federal court.
The California state tax code ""provides the exclusive means by which [a] dispute over the taxability of a retail sale may be resolved."" Loeffler v. Target Corp., 324 P.3d 50, 54 (Cal. 2014). ""[T]he administrative tax refund procedures enacted by the Legislature are to be strictly enforced,"" and ""courts may not expand the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the Legislature."" McClain v. Sav-on Drugs, 215 Cal. Rptr. 3d 416, 425 (Cal. App. 2nd Dist. 2017) (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). The California Supreme Court describes those procedures:
[W]ith respect to excess reimbursement charges, section 6901.5 contemplates that it is for the Board [of Equalization] to ascertain under its normal procedures whether any mistake has been made. If the matter is not raised through an audit or a deficiency determination, it is for the taxpayer [i.e., the retailer] to claim a refund from the Board, which may in turn require the taxpayer to refund excess reimbursement to consumers. Again, section 6901.5 confirms that binding decisions on such disputes are committed to the Board in the first instance, with the taxpayer as the party with standing to make a claim for a refund. . . . [T]he consumer lacks standing in disputes over the application of the tax law to particular transactions.
Loeffler, 324 P.3d at 78 (emphasis in original).
Laquer's claim is dependent on resolving a ""taxability"" question: namely, whether a nonrefundable car reservation is a taxable transaction if the consumer does not consummate the reservation. But because Laquer is the consumer, rather than the taxpayer, he is not the proper party to assert this claim under California law.[3] Accordingly, Laquer lacks prudential standing whether he brings the claim pursuant to § 6204 or § 6901.5.
Laquer's claim must be dismissed for the additional reason that he has failed to comply with a mandatory state-law administrative remedy. See Holt v. Town of Stonington, 765 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2014). The California tax code ""contemplates that the method by which the taxability of a sale may be challenged and determined is through an audit or deficiency determination made by the Board, or through a taxpayer02b9s refund claim before the Board, followed by judicial review of the Board02b9s decision."" Loeffler. 324 P.3d at 77 (emphasis in original). If the applicable tax is a use tax, then Lacquer might seek a refund by presenting his receipt to the Board under the refund provision of § 6901. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6901. If the applicable tax is a sales tax, then Loeffler holds that Lacquer's exclusive remedy would be to request the Board to ""ascertain"" whether he has been charged excessive reimbursement. Loeffler, 324 P.3d at 74. In any event, Lacquer must exhaust his administrative remedies before the Board before he may bring an action in court. Id. at 64.
We have considered Laquer's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without any merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
[1]  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to amend the caption as set forth above.
[2]  False representation is not a cognizable cause of action. Laquer's First Amended Complaint (""FAC"") repleaded the purported false representation as a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.
[3]  Loeffler notes that in certain limited circumstances, a consumer may file an action compelling a taxpayer to seek a refund. 324 P.3d at 74. This remedy is available only if ""(1) the person seeking the new tax refund remedy has no statutory tax refund remedy available to it, (2) the tax refund remedy sought is not inconsistent with existing tax refund remedies, and (3) the Board has already determined that the person seeking the new tax refund remedy is entitled to a refund, such that the refusal to create that remedy will unjustly enrich either the taxpayer/retailer or the Board."" McClain, 215 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 420. Laquer does not allege that the Board has already determined that he is entitled to a refund, and there is therefore no ground to conclude that his claim falls within the narrow set of circumstances under which a consumer may file an action against a retailer for a tax refund.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Pedro Cristian Fernandez-Bravo appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissing his Complaint pursuant to a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Fernandez-Bravo argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting the Defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing (1) the Fourth Amendment false arrest and malicious prosecution claims premised on the allegations that defendant Garay intentionally provided false information and omitted other information in her arrest warrant affidavit; (2) the substantive due process claim premised on the same allegations; (3) the First Amendment retaliation claim; and (4) the abuse of process claim. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. Plaintiff first challenges the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment false arrest and malicious prosecution claims, arguing that omissions and misrepresentations in the arrest warrant undermined probable cause for his arrest, and Officer Garay should not be covered by qualified immunity.
We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Sousa v. Marquez, 702 F.3d 124, 127 (2d Cir. 2012); see also Lederman v. New York City Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 731 F.3d 199, 202 (2d Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).
The first question is whether there was probable cause to arrest Fernandez-Bravo. ""Probable cause to arrest exists when the officers have knowledge of, or reasonably trustworthy information as to, facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested."" Zellner v. Summerlin, 494 F.3d 344, 368 (2d Cir. 2007). ""In deciding whether probable cause existed for an arrest, we assess whether the facts known by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest objectively provided probable cause to arrest. Whether probable cause existed for the charge actually invoked by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest is irrelevant."" Ackerson v. City of White Plains, 702 F.3d 15, 19-20 (2d Cir. 2012), as amended (Dec. 4, 2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). ""Because probable cause to arrest constitutes justification, there can be no claim for false arrest where the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff."" Escalera v. Lunn, 361 F.3d 737, 743 (2d Cir. 2004). The same conclusion obtains as to malicious prosecution, because lack of probable cause is an element of the offense, see Golino v. City of New Haven, 950 F.2d 864, 866-867, 870 (2d Cir. 1991), although malicious prosecution claims—certainly when asserting injury beyond the simple fact of arrest—can require courts to address probable cause for each charged crime. See Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, 82 F.3d 563, 571 (2d Cir. 1996).
Even accepting as true Fernandez-Bravo's allegations as to omitted or misrepresented information, and resolving credibility disputes in his favor, we conclude that probable cause existed to arrest and detain him for each of the charges at issue. See, generally, Walczyk v. Rio, 496 F.3d 139, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2007) (discussing probable cause standard). There is no dispute that Fernandez-Bravo sent threatening emails to his ex-wife, in violation of his protective order. A few of the excerpts cited in the district court's Memorandum of Decision serve to illustrate: ""DON'T MAKE ME YOUR EXECUTIONER;"" ""TICK TOCK, TICK TOCK, TIME IS RUNNING OUT ON YOU;"" ""Don't make me destroy you."" Special App'x at 7. The omitted or misleading facts Fernandez-Bravo relies on do not change the menacing tone of his emails, each of which furnished probable cause to arrest him for a separate violation of the protective order. Further, the totality of his communications, including the July 2, 2009 telephone conversation, by whomever initiated, supplied probable cause for stalking under Connecticut law. See Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§ 53a-181d and e. No intervening fact rendered the charges against Fernandez-Bravo groundless. Thus Fernandez-Bravo's false arrest and malicious prosecution claims were properly dismissed.
In addition, all of the individual officers are entitled to qualified immunity from Fernandez-Bravo's false arrest and malicious prosecution claims.[1] ""Qualified immunity protects officials from liability for civil damages as long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known."" Taravella v. Town of Wolcott, 599 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""A police officer is entitled to qualified immunity if (1) his conduct does not violate a clearly established constitutional right, or (2) it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe his conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right."" Hartline v. Gallo, 546 F.3d 95, 102 (2d Cir. 2008)(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The qualified immunity standard is ""forgiving"" and ""protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law."" Amore v. Novarro, 624 F.3d 522, 530 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Since Officer Garay had probable cause to arrest Fernandez-Bravo, she also is entitled to qualified immunity from his claims. Indeed, all Officer Garay needs is arguable probable cause to be protected by qualified immunity, see Garcia v. Does, 779 F.3d 84, 92 (2d Cir. 2015), which is plainly evident here. We therefore also affirm under qualified immunity.
2. Challenging the dismissal of his substantive due process claim, Fernandez-Bravo reiterates his arguments that alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the arrest warrant undermined probable cause for his arrest, that Officer Garay therefore does not enjoy qualified immunity, and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. Where ""the Fourth Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against [a type] of physically intrusive governmental conduct, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of `substantive due process,' must be the guide for analy[sis] . . ."" Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989). Because Fernandez-Bravo's due process claim stems from the same behavior alleged in his Fourth Amendment false arrest claim, his substantive due process claim merges with that claim, and was properly dismissed for the same reasons.
3. Fernandez-Bravo argues that he provides sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that he suffered retaliation for refusing to drop his immigration complaint against Rojas. ""To prevail on this free speech claim, plaintiff must prove: (1) he has an interest protected by the First Amendment; (2) defendants' actions were motivated or substantially caused by his exercise of that right; and (3) defendants' actions effectively chilled the exercise of his First Amendment right."" Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, 268 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2001). ""Specific proof of improper motivation is required in order for plaintiff to survive summary judgment on a First Amendment retaliation claim."" Id. He provides none. While ""circumstantial evidence may be . . . sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact precluding the grant of summary judgment,"" Gayle v. Gonyea, 313 F.3d 677, 684 (2d Cir. 2002), Fernandez-Bravo relies exclusively on his own assertions; but they are completely undermined: Fernandez-Bravo admits he did not see Officers Garay or Maston speak; Officer Maston testified that he was unaware of any immigration complaint until after the arrest of Fernandez-Bravo; and Rojas was arrested by Officer Garay after she had entered Fernandez-Bravo's home. The defendants enjoy qualified immunity as to this claim as well.
4. Finally, Fernandez-Bravo argues that he provides sufficient evidence of an improper primary purpose to support his abuse of process claim, and that qualified immunity is not a defense to this claim. He relies on the same factual arguments made in his First Amendment claim. ""An action for abuse of process lies against any person using a legal process against another in an improper manner or to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed."" Larobina v. McDonald, 274 Conn. 394, 403 (2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The improper purpose must be the primary purpose for the process effected upon a plaintiff, because ""the addition of primarily is meant to exclude liability when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of benefit to the defendant."" Id. at 403-404. There is no evidence that the ""retaliatory purpose"" alleged by Fernandez-Bravo was the primary purpose for the process effected on him; indeed, as discussed above, other than his own statements, there is no evidence of any retaliatory motive.
Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.
[1]  Fernandez-Bravo's brief only attacks qualified immunity as to Officer Garay; he therefore waives any challenge to district court's finding that the other police officer defendants possessed qualified immunity.

ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.
Appellants Waterford Township Police & Fire Retirement System and City of Roseville Employees' Retirement System (""Appellants"") appeal from the January 27, 2017 opinion and order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Swain, J.), denying them leave to file a third amended complaint. Waterford Township Police & Fire Retirement System v. Regional Mgmt. Corp., 2017 WL 395206 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2017) (""Waterford Township II""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.
We review de novo denials of leave to amend complaints on grounds of futility. Kassner v. 2nd Avenue Delicatessen Inc., 496 F.3d 229, 242 (2d Cir. 2007). Reviewing the denial of a motion to amend on futility grounds effectively requires us to determine whether the proposed amended complaint succeeds in stating a claim. Id. at 244; IBEW Local Union No. 58 Pension Trust Fund & Annuity Fund v. Royal Bank of Scotland Grp., PLC, 783 F.3d 383, 389 (2d Cir. 2015). In so doing, we accept all well pled allegations as true and draw all plausible inferences in plaintiffs' favor. See Stadnick v. Vivint Solar, Inc., 861 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 2017).
Appellants' complaint first alleges that Regional Management and its executives (collectively, ""RM"") made material misrepresentations about their underwriting practices. The district court found that many of these were inactionable because they were ""in the nature of belief or opinion."" Waterford Township Police & Fire Retirement System v. Regional Mgmt. Corp., 2016 WL 1261135, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2016) (""Waterford Township I""). It further found that, the complaint failed to establish that any of these statements were misrepresentations in any case, since it contained no facts indicating that RM ""did not believe the statements were true at the time they were made."" Id.
We need not address the former ruling, because we agree with the latter. The third amended complaint does not indicate that the statements RM made were ""misleading as to a material fact."" Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. 27, 38 (2011) (citation and emphasis omitted). Appellants refer to the statements of a number of former employees to support their claim that RM misled investors about its underwriting practices. Although many of these statements indicate that RM's branches had shoddy underwriting practices and that live check loans were especially likely to result in defaults, none of them contains any information either way as to whether underwriting for live check loans, which occurred at RM headquarters, was especially bad during the Class Period. These facts are just as consistent with the possibility that RM believed what it was saying about its underwriting practices (and that its beliefs were correct) as the opposite. That is not enough to survive a motion to dismiss. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (""Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief."") (citation and internal quotation marks removed).
Appellants also allege that RM made material misrepresentations about the adequacy of staffing in its loan servicing departments. We agree with the district court that these allegations amount to ""fraud by hindsight"" because ""Plaintiffs plead no facts demonstrating that the Company did not actually believe that it could achieve increased labor productivity with the increased loan volume at the time it made the positive statements, nor do they identify any contemporaneous facts that would have rendered such a belief unfounded."" Waterford Township I, 2016 WL 1261135, at *11; see also Novak v. Kasaks, 216 F.3d 300, 309 (2d Cir. 2000)). Investors frequently clamor for cutting labor costs to pay out more in profits. Such a strategy risks favoring short-term payouts at the expense of the medium term. We need something more than hypotheticals to conclude that such a ho-hum feature of capitalist enterprise was in fact a guise to defraud those it often benefits.
We have considered the remainder of Appellants' arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.

Odell Willis appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Suddaby, J.) dismissing, on summary judgment, his Complaint against the County of Onondaga (the ""County""). Willis alleges that he suffered racial and sex discrimination while employed as a deputy sheriff at the Onondaga County sheriff's office, and that the County failed to stop it. The alleged misconduct included unwanted sexual touching and graphic sexual comments by ""Sergeant B"" and fellow deputies, racially hostile comments and actions by fellow deputies, and retaliation for filing a complaint of racial and sex discrimination. Willis asserts six causes of action, including violations of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and the New York State Human Rights Law. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
We review de novo a grant of summary judgment, VKK Corp. Nat'l v. Football League, 244 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001), ""view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, . . . draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of that party, and . . . eschew[ing] credibility assessments."" Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 122 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
To prevail on a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that ""the discriminatory harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, and that a specific basis exists for imputing the objectionable conduct to the employer."" Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 439 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the alleged harasser supervises the plaintiff, the objectionable conduct is imputed to the employer. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998). The employer may assert an affirmative defense by establishing (1) ""that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any . . . harassing behavior"" and (2) ""that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise."" Id. If the alleged harasser is a coworker, the plaintiff must show that the employer ""either provided no reasonable avenue for complaint or knew of the harassment but did nothing about it."" Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., 223 F.3d 62, 72 (2d Cir. 2000).
As an initial matter, Willis contends that the district court failed to consider certain instances of misconduct. Willis assumes that the court deemed them time-barred because they pre-dated August 7, 2013, the statutory cut-off date 300 days prior to the filing of the EEOC complaint, and Willis argues that the continuing violation doctrine revives these claims. However, the district court in fact concluded that Willis was relitigating them, because he could have (but did not) raise the claims in a prior action involving the same parties, which resulted in an adjudication on the merits. See Special App'x 31; TechnoMarine SA v. Giftports, Inc., 758 F.3d 493, 499 (2d Cir. 2014). Willis does not address why claim preclusion does not therefore bar consideration of these instances of misconduct.
The record shows that the County took reasonable care to prevent discriminatory behavior and provided a reasonable avenue for complaints. The sheriff's office had policies forbidding racial and sexual harassment; all deputy sheriffs received yearly diversity training that explains the office's policies; and both Willis and his alleged harassers received training on the issue of harassment. Willis argues that he did not report certain instances of misconduct because he feared reprisal by Lieutenant Raus; but he also testified that Lieutenant Greco had ""an open door"" and that Willis felt comfortable talking to him. App'x 198. Furthermore, Willis' fear of reprisal did not stop him from complaining about incidents of misconduct to individuals both inside and outside of the sheriff's office during the same time period. App'x 198-202.
The record also shows that the sheriff's office investigated Willis' complaints of misconduct when he chose to report them. For instance, when Willis complained that someone had torn down his poster of Martin Luther King from his locker, Sergeant Marshall replaced the poster and addressed the matter at roll call. When Sergeant Marshall heard a racial slur broadcast over a deputy's cellphone, he immediately addressed the matter and issued a disciplinary supervisor's memorandum. When Willis complained about seeing a photograph of a deputy handcuffed inside a shopping cart, the matter was investigated and supervisor's memoranda were issued. When Willis complained that ""Deputy A"" had punched him in the leg to give him a ""Charlie horse,"" the sheriff's office investigated and issued a supervisor's memorandum.
As to Sergeant B, the complaints were investigated by Sergeant Marshall and Lieutenant Raus. Willis argues that the sheriff's office did not follow its own policy to have the Professional Standards Unit (""PSU"") conduct the investigation; but Willis testified that he was interviewed by the PSU regarding his complaints about Sergeant B. And there is no record evidence to support Willis' assertion that these investigations were biased.
Despite having knowledge of the complaint procedure in the sheriff's office, Willis did not complain about witnessing Deputy A giving the so-called ""Polish handshake"" to other deputies and feeling re-victimized as a result, and there is no evidence in the record that other supervisors were aware of these incidents. Accordingly, the County cannot be held liable under Title VII for this conduct because it did not have knowledge that it occurred.
As to Willis' argument that the sheriff's office did not exercise reasonable care to prevent harassment because he was continuously partnered with Deputy A, Willis testified that he was paired with a different deputy and that prior to his partnership with Deputy A the individuals he worked with varied.
Finally, Willis argues that the district court should not have dismissed his retaliation claim. Willis' Complaint asserts six causes of action, none of which was a claim for retaliation: he mentioned the word ""retaliate"" only twice, App'x 608-09 (Compl. ¶ 21), but omitted ""retaliation"" from the Causes of Action section of the Complaint, leading the County and the district court to conclude reasonably that Willis had chosen not to assert the claim.
We have considered Willis' remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiffs-appellants James Crawford and Thaddeus Corley appeal the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Mordue, J.) dismissing the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that defendants-appellees Simon Prindle and William P. Brown were entitled to qualified immunity for the conduct alleged to have occurred in 2011. Crawford and Corley claim that Prindle fondled their genitals during patfrisks when they were inmates at a state prison, and that Brown was deliberately indifferent to Prindle's predations, all in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In a previous appeal, we expounded upon an inmate's right to be free of sexual abuse in light of evolving standards of decency and ruled that plaintiffs' complaint stated a cause of action. Crawford v. Cuomo, 796 F.3d 252 (2d Cir. 2015) (Crawford I). The nub of the question before us is whether an official who engaged in abhorrent conduct that would not be condoned post-Crawford I would nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity if the conduct occurred before Crawford I when the right the plaintiffs claim had arguably not yet been clearly established. On remand, the district court awarded Prindle and Brown qualified immunity. We assume the parties' familiarity with the remaining facts and procedural history of this case, as well as the issues on appeal. ""We review the grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Elias v. Rolling Stone LLC, 872 F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).
A state official is entitled to qualified immunity ""unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was `clearly established' at the time of the challenged conduct."" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). A right is clearly established when its `""contours . . . are sufficiently clear'"" that, at the time of the challenged conduct, ""every `reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.'"" Id. at 741 (alterations omitted) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). ""[G]eneral statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning to officers,"" but ""existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate."" White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552, 551 (2017) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""The dispositive question is `whether the violative nature of the particular conduct is clearly established.'"" Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015) (per curiam) (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742).
Plaintiffs first argue that the violative nature of Prindle's conduct was clearly established by Boddie v. Schnieder, where we stated that ""sexual abuse of a prisoner by a corrections officer may in some circumstances violate the prisoner's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment."" 105 F.3d 857, 860-61 (2d Cir. 1997). This argument is not persuasive. Although Boddie held that inmate sexual abuse could, in principle, violate the Eighth Amendment, it concluded that a ""small number of incidents in which [the plaintiff] allegedly was verbally harassed, touched, and pressed against without his consent"" were insufficient to state a claim. Id. at 861. Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, the allegations we considered in Boddie are quite similar to the allegations here. A reasonable officer could therefore have believed that the sexual abuse here alleged, even if it might violate state criminal law or subject him to tort liability, did not violate the Eighth Amendment. At a minimum, any constitutional distinction between this case and Boddie was not clearly established in March 2011.
Our statement in Crawford I that ""[t]he standard set forth in Boddie, which condemns Prindle's alleged conduct, remains the same today"" does not compel a different conclusion, because we simultaneously stated that ""conduct that might not have been seen to rise to the severity of an Eighth Amendment violation 18 years ago may now violate community standards of decency, and for that reason, we believe that the officer's conduct in Boddie would flunk its own test today."" Crawford I, 796 F.3d at 259-60. For this reason, an officer who sexually abuses an inmate following Crawford I will not prevail by arguing that he did not violate clearly established law. However, because Prindle allegedly abused the plaintiffs in 2011, they do not have the benefit of the decision.
Plaintiffs next argue that, in 2011, out-of-circuit authorities ""clearly foreshadow[ed]"" our holding in Crawford I that Prindle's actions violated the Constitution. See Terebesi v. Torreso, 764 F.3d 217, 231 (2d Cir. 2014). We disagree. Although some other courts had described an inmate's right to be free of sexual abuse in admirably clear, broad terms,[1] ""[t]he dispositive question is whether the violative nature of the particular conduct is clearly established,"" Mullenix, 136 S. Ct. at 308 (internal quotation marks omitted), and out-of-circuit authority was, at the time, sharply divided on whether abuse comparable to Prindle's was cruel and unusual. Compare, e.g., Jackson v. Madery, 158 F. App'x 656, 661 (6th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (finding insufficient, for Eighth Amendment purposes, allegations of ""rubbing and grabbing [plaintiff's] buttocks in a degrading and humiliating manner during a `shakedown' in the prison food area""), with Berry v. Oswalt, 143 F.3d 1127, 1131 (8th Cir. 1998) (finding evidence sufficient where officer ""had attempted to perform nonroutine patdowns on [plaintiff], had propositioned her for sex, had intruded upon her while she was not fully dressed, and had subjected her to sexual comments""). Accordingly, out-of-circuit authorities did not clearly foreshadow Crawford I's holding.
Plaintiffs also invoke the legislative developments that underpinned Crawford I's expansion of an inmate's right to be free of sexual abuse. See Crawford I, 796 F.3d at 259-60. They argue both that Boddie is a self-updating decision that incorporated future legislative developments into this Court's case law without the need for further judicial decisions and that these legislative developments clearly foreshadowed Crawford I. We are not persuaded. Although we may consider legislative materials when analyzing qualified immunity, we do so ""in conjunction with prevailing circuit or Supreme Court law,"" Okin v. Vill. of Cornwall-On-Hudson Police Dep't, 577 F.3d 415, 433-34 (2d Cir. 2009), not in place of it. The legislative developments plaintiffs point to cannot clearly establish or foreshadow the holding in Crawford I, where our cases suggested that conduct like Prindle's, although reprehensible and possibly criminal, did not violate the Eighth Amendment, and out-of-circuit authority at best made the constitutionality of Prindle's conduct debatable.
Finally, plaintiffs argue that immunizing defendants-appellees' conduct would contravene the purposes of qualified immunity because Prindle, in sexually abusing Crawford and Corley, acted far beyond the scope of his legitimate duties. ""Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions,"" al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 743, but at the same time, ""[w]here an official could be expected to know that certain conduct would violate statutory or constitutional rights, he should be made to hesitate,"" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 819. We are in full agreement that Prindle's alleged conduct was repugnant and intolerable, and, as we noted at the outset, would clearly not be condoned if it occurred today in light of Crawford I. But qualified immunity does not ""turn on the precise nature of various officials' duties or the precise character of the particular rights alleged to have been violated,"" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 643, and the sole question we must answer is whether the ""federal right on which the claim for relief is based"" was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct, see Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 515 (1994). Because we conclude that the unconstitutional nature of Prindle's abuse was not clearly established in 2011, qualified immunity was properly recognized.[2]
We have considered the parties' remaining arguments and have found in them no basis for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Defendant-appellant Derrick Jabbar Brown appeals from a September 23, 2016 amended judgment of the district court, resentencing him, in relevant part, to special conditions imposed on him previously pursuant to two judgments: one convicting him of possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252(a)(4)(B) and 2252(b)(2), and the other revoking supervised release from a 2005 conviction for distribution of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(1) and 2252A(b)(1). On appeal, Brown argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his resentencing when his attorney failed to: (1) challenge the testimony of an expert witness called by the court, and (2) to call his own rebuttal expert witness. Brown seeks resentencing, or in the alternative, remand for further factual development of the record. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. Brown argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his resentencing hearing for two reasons. First, his trial counsel did not challenge the substance of the opinion expressed by the expert witness, Dr. DeSantis. Thus he believes that his trial counsel's cross-examination of the witness was utterly deficient and not based on sound trial strategy. Second, Brown argues that his trial counsel's decision to not call a rebuttal witness to Dr. DeSantis was similarly utterly deficient.
""The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to effective representation,"" and when ""assessing a claim that a lawyer's representation did not meet the constitutional minimum, we indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct f[ell] within the wide range of professional assistance."" Lynch v. Dolce, 789 F.3d 303, 311 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotations omitted, alteration in original). To overcome this strong presumption, a petitioner must establish that: (1) his ""counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness""; and (2) ""any deficiencies in counsel's performance must be prejudicial to the defense[.]"" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 692 (1984). For the reasonableness prong, the petitioner must demonstrate ""that counsel's representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy."" Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 381 (1986). As to prejudice, the petitioner must demonstrate ""that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. A court need not address both prongs of the Strickland test; if either fails, the entire claim fails. Id. at 697. ""The question of whether a defendant's lawyer's representation violates the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed de novo."" United States v. Blau, 159 F.3d 68, 74 (2d Cir. 1998).
When a party brings a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, ""we may: (1) decline to hear the claim, permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255; (2) remand the claim to the district court for necessary factfinding; or (3) decide the claim on the record before us."" United States v. Morris, 350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir. 2003). ""Generally, Courts of Appeals are reluctant to address ineffectiveness claims on direct review"" because ""the constitutional sufficiency of counsel's performance is usually unripe for seasoned retrospection"" on direct review. United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 160 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam). But we permit direct review of such claims when ""its resolution is `beyond any doubt' or to do so would be in the interest of justice."" United States v. Stantini, 85 F.3d 9, 20 (2d Cir. 1996) (internal citation omitted).
This case is the unusual one in which direct review is warranted, because it is beyond any doubt that Brown is unable establish prejudice for two reasons. First, Brown does not demonstrate or explain how different cross-examination questions or tactics would have overcome the quantity of evidence the district court relied on to make its decision imposing the special conditions: Brown's repeated child pornography arrests, his storage of adult and child pornography together, and his resistance to treatment. Brown argues he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to highlight Dr. DeSantis' failure to examine Brown to determine whether the special conditions were warranted for him specifically. But regardless of whether Dr. DeSantis examined Brown, his multiple offenses and unrepentant attitude about child pornography demonstrate his particular need for these special conditions as part of his treatment.[1] Second, Brown's trial counsel's cross-examination was actually effective. Dr. DeSantis, who was called by the court only for a general discussion of treatment options, stated under cross-examination that treatment options can differ depending on the offender, and that it was appropriate in some cases to discontinue the sexual offender portion of treatment before the term of supervision ends. Defense counsel cited this testimony at the final resentencing proceeding, and sought to limit the special conditions to the time Brown was in treatment. The district court substantially acquiesced to this: the court did not impose the special conditions for the entire period of supervised release, but only while a therapist deems them necessary. Given the evidence against Brown, and his counsel's seeming success, it is implausible that additional cross-examination or the calling of a rebuttal expert would create ""a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.
2. We conclude that remand for further fact finding is not necessary. While we agree with Brown that this is a discrete issue, there is no need for further factual development to dispose of it.
Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.
[1]  Brown told the Probation Department that he ""did not think it was wrong to view child pornography, since it did not involve touching a minor, and he hoped in the future to relocate to a country where viewing child pornography was legal."" 2014 Presentencing Report, ¶ 6.

Plaintiff J. Graham Zahoruiko, proceeding pro se, appeals from an award of summary judgment to Federal Insurance Company (""Federal"") on Zahoruiko's breach of contract and related claims based on Federal's denial of coverage under a director and officer liability insurance policy. Specifically, Zahoruiko challenges the district court's determination that he was not entitled to coverage under Connecticut law because he did not timely notify Federal of the claims for which he sought insurance coverage. We review the challenged award de novo and will affirm only if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Zahoruiko, shows no genuine dispute of material fact and Federal's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. See Jackson v. Fed. Express, 766 F.3d 189, 193-94 (2d Cir. 2014). In doing so, we assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.

Under Connecticut law, an insurer can be discharged from its coverage obligations pursuant to the ""notice"" provision of an insurance policy only by showing: ""(1) an unexcused, unreasonable delay in notification by the insured; and (2) resulting material prejudice to the insurer."" Arrowood Indem. Co. v. King, 605 F.3d 62, 77 (2d Cir. 2010). Insofar as Zahoruiko argues on appeal that Federal failed to show prejudice, he forfeited the argument by failing to raise it in the district court. See Harrison v. Republic of Sudan, 838 F.3d 86, 96 (2d Cir. 2016) (""It is a well-established general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal."" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). In any event, upon an independent review of the record and relevant case law, we conclude, as the district court did, that Federal is entitled to summary judgment.
An insured's ""duty to give notice does not arise unless and until facts develop which would suggest to a person of ordinary and reasonable prudence that liability may have been incurred, and is complied with if notice is given within a reasonable time after the situation so assumes an aspect suggestive of a possible claim for damages."" Arrowood Indem. Co. v. King, 605 F.3d at 77 (internal quotation marks omitted). ""The purpose of the requirement for prompt notice is to give the insurer a full opportunity to investigate the claim."" Id. at 78. As to the prejudice prong, ""the insurer bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that it has been prejudiced by the insured's failure to comply with a notice provision."" Arrowood Indem. Co. v. King, 39 A.3d 712, 725-26 (Conn. 2012).
Zahoruiko's delay in notifying Federal of his need for coverage was both unexcused and unreasonable. When the action at issue was commenced against Zahoruiko in 2010, a reasonably prudent person would have understood that liability might be incurred. Moreover, when default was entered against Zahoruiko, he certainly should have known that he could be found liable. Nevertheless, Zahoruiko failed to notify Federal until one and a half years after the lawsuit was commenced and 15 months after the default. Insofar as Zahoruiko argues that his untimely notice should be excused because the entity that sued him engaged in unscrupulous tactics, he fails to explain how that conduct prevented him from timely providing notice of the action to Federal.
Zahoruiko's arguments that the district court improperly assumed prejudice and that Federal failed to carry its preponderance burden are equally meritless. Federal provided a declaration from a senior claim officer stating that Zahoruiko's failure to give notice until after default was entered denied it the opportunity to interview witnesses or participate in the defense or any proposed settlement of the claim. Zahoruiko argues that the declaration is speculative, and that Federal would not have defended his claim because it denied coverage based on a different clause of the policy. The argument does not persuade. Connecticut recognizes that the denial of the opportunity to investigate, as well as entry of default, are prejudicial to an insurer. Ellis v. Cty. Agency, Inc., No. CV146017155S, 2017 WL 3011674, at *3 (Conn. Super. Ct. May 25, 2017) (""Entry of a default judgment against an insured is evidence of prejudice as well as the lack of opportunity for the insurer to investigate a claim and to pursue a compromise or settlement."" (internal citation omitted)); Jazlowiecki v. Nationwide Ins. Co. of Am., No. HHDCV126036618S, 2014 WL 4746527, at *6 (Conn. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2014) (same). Zahoruiko's prejudice challenge is further belied by his own waiver in the underlying action of defenses that Federal could otherwise have asserted. Federal having carried its burden, and Zahoruiko having failed to adduce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict in his favor, see Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., 302 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir. 2002), or even to challenge Federal's showing of prejudice in the district court, summary judgment was correctly entered in Federal's favor.
We have considered Zahoruiko's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
>Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Iman McIntosh appeals from a final judgment entered by the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to each of McIntosh's causes of action. McIntosh v. City of New York, No. 14 Civ. 51, 2017 WL 473840 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2017) (Block, J.). ""We review a grant of summary judgment de novo,"" viewing ""the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and resolv[ing] all factual ambiguities in its favor."" Coppola v. Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., 499 F.3d 144, 148 (2d Cir. 2007). Summary judgment is warranted ""if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). ""Material facts are those which `might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,' and a dispute is `genuine' if `the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'"" Coppola, 499 F.3d at 148 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
On the evening of August 26, 2013, McIntosh and Kristopher Vecchio each called 911 to report that the other had attacked them. A police dispatcher relayed the substance of Vecchio's and McIntosh's calls and requested that officers respond to their apartment, informing the officers that ""male caller states his girlfriend came home and attacked him, said she's intoxicated, has injuries to his face and his chest, and she bit him,"" and that ""the female called and stated that she was assaulted by her boyfriend, and she has a cut on her leg, and she's requesting EMS."" App. 375. In response, Defendants-Appellees Harold Taylor, Hong Chen, Chong Yi, James Kelly, and Jawad Javed arrived at the scene of the dispute. Vecchio and McIntosh each reiterated their complaints that they had been attacked and the officers observed that each showed signs of having been involved in a fight: Vecchio had scratch and bite marks on his body, while McIntosh's leg was bleeding. Both McIntosh and Vecchio were arrested. McIntosh's leg wound was treated in an ambulance upon her arrest and she was twice taken to, and discharged from, New York Presbyterian Hospital between her arrest on August 26th and her arraignment on August 28th. McIntosh was released on her own recognizance and charges against her of assault and harassment were voluntarily dismissed by the Queens District Attorney approximately two weeks later, on September 12, 2013. On these undisputed facts, we find that McIntosh fails to raise a question of material fact on any of the causes of action at issue on this appeal.
First, there was probable cause for both McIntosh's arrest and the initiation of her prosecution. As set forth above, the arresting officers were sent to the scene of a dispute by a dispatcher who informed them that Vecchio alleged he had been attacked by McIntosh, Vecchio reiterated that allegation upon the officers' arrival, and they observed that Vecchio had been scratched and bitten. The officers' observations of Vecchio's injuries, in conjunction with his complaints, were sufficient to allow them to reasonably believe that McIntosh had committed assault in the third degree and harassment in the second degree. See N.Y. Penal Law §§ 120.00, 240.26. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted on McIntosh's causes of action for malicious prosecution, Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 215 (2d Cir. 2012), false arrest, Escalera v. Lunn, 361 F.3d 737, 743 (2d Cir. 2004), and abuse of process, Mangino v. Inc. Vill. of Patchogue, 808 F.3d 951, 957-59 (2d Cir. 2015) (ruling on qualified immunity grounds).
McIntosh argues that the officers should not have believed Vecchio's version of events and instead should have credited her allegations that Vecchio had attacked her. We reject this argument. ""[A]bsent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim's veracity[,] . . . [t]he veracity of citizen complaints who are the victims of the very crime they report to the police is assumed."" Lee v. Sandberg, 136 F.3d 94, 103 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, 268 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001) (""[W]e have found probable cause where a police officer was presented with different stories from an alleged victim and the arrestee"" and ""where an arresting officer chose to believe the claimed victim's account of a fight based on his visible injuries, notwithstanding the alleged assailant's cries of innocence.""). Where there are conflicting accounts, officers ""are neither required nor allowed to sit as prosecutor, judge or jury. Their function is to apprehend those suspected of wrongdoing, and not to finally determine guilt through a weighing of the evidence."" Krause v. Bennett, 887 F.2d 362, 372 (2d Cir. 1989).
Second, although McIntosh also contends that she was denied her right to substantive due process on the ground that evidence was falsified concurrent with or subsequent to her arrest, ""[t]he manufacture of false evidence, in and of itself, . . . does not impair anyone's liberty, and therefore does not impair anyone's constitutional right."" Zahrey v. Coffey, 221 F.3d 342, 348 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no basis for finding that McIntosh suffered a deprivation of liberty as a result of fabricated evidence because her arrest was supported by probable cause, she was subsequently released on her own recognizance at her arraignment, and the charges against were dismissed shortly thereafter. Summary judgment with respect to her due process claim was therefore proper. See id. (""[I]f Zahrey had claimed only that Coffee fabricated evidence and did nothing to precipitate the sequence of events that resulted in a deprivation of Zahrey's liberty, no constitutional violation would have been alleged."").[2]
Third, the defendants did not improperly deprive McIntosh of necessary medical care. McIntosh would have a valid cause of action ""if the defendants denied her, an unconvicted detainee, `treatment needed to remedy a serious medical condition and did so because of their deliberate indifference to that need.'"" Cuocco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 106 (2d Cir. 2000) (alteration omitted, quoting Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 856 (2d Cir. 1996)). That is simply not what happened here. Rather, the record makes clear that McIntosh was in police custody for a total of approximately 36 hours, during which time her leg wound was treated in an ambulance and she was twice taken by defendants to a hospital for further medical treatment. To the extent that McIntosh believes that she received inadequate treatment, ""mere disagreement over the proper treatment does not create a constitutional claim."" Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir. 1998); cf. Dean v. Coughlin, 804 F.2d 207, 215 (2d Cir. 1986) (""We are governed by the principle that the objective is not to impose upon a state prison a model system of [medical] care beyond average needs but to provide the minimum level of [medical] care required by the Constitution. . . . The essential test is one of medical necessity and not one simply of desirability."" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).
Finally, the district court properly dismissed McIntosh's failure to intervene claim. That cause of action is predicated on there being an underlying violation of McIntosh's constitutional rights that the defendants could have prevented. See, e.g., Terebesi v. Torreso, 764 F.3d 217, 243 (2d Cir. 2014) (""An officer who fails to intercede in the . . . constitutional violation is liable for the preventable harm caused by the actions of other officers.""). Because there have been no violations of McIntosh's constitutional rights, as discussed above, it necessarily follows that the defendants cannot be liable for their failure to intercede in such non-existent violations.
We have considered all of the plaintiff's arguments on this appeal and find in them no basis for vacatur. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to amend the official caption in this case to conform with the caption above.
[2]  The district court erred in holding that the existence of probable cause alone defeated McIntosh's substantive due process cause of action. See McIntosh, 2017 WL 473840, at *5; contra Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 277-78 (2d Cir. 2016) (""In short, a Section 1983 claim for the denial of a right to a fair trial based on an officer's provision of false information to prosecutors can stand even if the officer had probable cause to arrest the Section 1983 plaintiff.""). We nevertheless find that the district court reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reason. See Grieve v. Tamerin, 269 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir. 2001) (""It is well established that we need not affirm for the reasons expressed by the district court but may affirm on any ground supported by the record."" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). In addition, although we note that there may be some tension in our jurisprudence concerning the fabrication of evidence, we need not resolve any such confusion here because McIntosh was not subjected any deprivation due to fabricated evidence. Compare, e.g., Dufort v. City of New York, 874 F.3d 338, 355 (2d Cir. 2017) (""Mere attempts to withhold or falsify evidence cannot form the basis for a § 1983 claim for a violation of the right to due process when those attempts have no impact on the conduct of a criminal trial"" because ""[t]he constitutional right on which [such a] claim rests is the right to have one's case tried based on an accurate evidentiary record that has not been manipulated by the prosecution.""); with Garnett, 838 F.3d at 277 (""The setting of bail, which may make the difference between freedom and confinement pending trial, and the prosecutor's decision to pursue charges rather than to dismiss the complaint without further action, may depend on the prosecutor's and magistrate's assessments of the strengths of the case, which in turn may be critically influenced by fabricated evidence. Thus, a further deprivation of liberty can result from the fabrication of evidence even if the initial arrest is lawful."").

RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Anthony Dyous appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissing the case.[1] We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Dyous was committed to a mental institution in Connecticut on March 22, 1985, for a term not to exceed 25 years, having been declared insane after he hijacked a bus in Hartford to spread the gospel of an impending nuclear conflagration. The state moved to continue Dyous' commitment beyond his original term, and the court granted multiple extensions on the basis of Dyous' clinical condition. Dyous remains institutionalized. He challenges his detention as unlawful and seeks a declaratory judgment that his continued confinement by the Psychiatric Security Review Board (""the Board"") violates his constitutional rights. The district court granted the Board's motion to dismiss on the ground that Dyous could not contest his confinement by way of an action for declaratory judgment.
The single issue raised on appeal is whether Dyous can pursue a declaratory judgment action contesting his continued confinement as a violation of his constitutional rights or whether he must seek relief via a writ of habeas corpus.
Whenever an individual attacks the ""very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus."" Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973). In Preiser, the respondents alleged that deprivation of good conduct time credits ""was causing or would cause them to be in illegal physical confinement."" Id. at 487. The Court held that the allegation ""fell squarely within th[e] traditional scope of habeas corpus."" Id.
Following Preiser, a number of circuits have directly held that the Declaratory Judgment Act may not be used as a substitute for a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Rooney v. Secretary of the Army, 405 F.3d 1029, 1031 (D.C. Cir. 2005); United States v. Guitierrez, 116 F.3d 412, 415 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Mills v. Poole, 2008 WL 141729, 06-cv-842A, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2008) (""Where, as here, an alternative remedy was expressly created by statute to provide the relief sought, a declaratory judgment should not be granted.""). This result is also mandated by Wilkinson v. Dotson, where the Supreme Court emphasized that habeas corpus is the only avenue available to confined individuals who ""seek to invalidate the duration of their confinement—either directly through an injunction compelling speedier release or indirectly through a judicial determination that necessarily implies the unlawfulness of the State's custody."" 544 U.S. 74, 81 (2005).
Rather, a declaratory judgment action may only lie where the plaintiff seeks monetary damages or other relief that would not directly impact his or her sentence or duration of commitment. See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 554-55 (1974) (holding that declaratory judgment as a predicate to a damages award would not be barred, but that a civil rights claim that would affect the duration of incarceration is foreclosed by Preiser); see also Burnell v. Whidden, 3:05CV825(MRK), 2005 WL 2739085, at *3-4 (D. Conn. Oct. 19, 2005).
Because each of Dyous' constitutional claims would impact his confinement if adjudicated in his favor on the merits, a writ of habeas corpus is his only potential avenue of relief. The prayer for relief in Dyous' complaint seeks a declaration that ""the continuing confinement of the plaintiff by the defendant violates the rights of the plaintiff guaranteed"" by the Constitution. J. App'x at 15. His causes of action under the due process and equal protection clauses can only be construed as contentions that his detention in the mental facility is ""contrary to the Constitution or fundamental law."" Preiser, 411 U.S. at 485; cf. Griffin v. Alexander, 9:09-CV-1334(PJM/DEP), 2011 WL 4402119, at *8, *13 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2011)(determining that civil rights claims requesting order directing defendant's release to parole supervision not appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment but must be brought by habeas petition), report and recommendation adopted by 2011 WL 4343199 (N.D.N.Y. Sep. 14, 2011); Curro v. Myers, CV-86-1304, 1987 WL 12032, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. May 5, 1987)(""[I]nsofar as plaintiff seeks a declaration that his conviction was obtained without due process of law, he challenges the fact of his confinement."").
The distinctions Dyous draws between ""equity"" and ""law"" or ""writ"" and ""judgment"" are of no moment. Dyous is not pursuing monetary damages; he seeks a judicial ruling that his confinement is contrary to law. No matter how narrowly Dyous now asks us to construe his claims, he is directly and unambiguously challenging his confinement. See Judge, 2009 WL 928134, at *8 (declaratory judgment relief that would ""necessarily invalidate Plaintiff's current confinement"" barred). This rule is not just a formality. Congress ""clearly required exhaustion of adequate state remedies as a condition precedent to the invocation of federal judicial relief"" for a confined individual and it would ""wholly frustrate explicit congressional intent to hold that [Dyous] could evade this requirement by the simple expedient of putting a different label on [his] pleadings."" Preiser, 411 U.S. at 489-490.
For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Dyous's other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  While the district court did not specify whether its dismissal was pursuant to Federal Rule of civil Procedure 12(b)(1) or (6), we construe the dismissal as without prejudice to Dyous' ability to subsequently file a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2554.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-Appellant Michael Marom, proceeding pro se, appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Román, J.) entered on March 20, 2017, granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Police Officers John Herighty and Keira Knoesel, and dismissing claims against the Town of Greenburgh (""the Town""). Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Marom filed a complaint asserting, inter alia, false arrest and malicious prosecution claims against Officers Herighty and Knoesel, and the Town.[1] The complaint arose from an altercation that occurred following a town zoning board meeting involving Marom's application for an amended zoning variance. A number of Marom's neighbors, including Deborah Salerno, objected to Marom's application. Following the meeting, Marom struck Salerno in the face and was subsequently arrested by Officers Herighty and Knoesel for third degree assault. Marom's wife, who witnessed the incident, informed at least one officer on the scene prior to Marom's arrest that Salerno had kicked Marom before he struck her. Salerno described the pain caused by the slap to officers as ""excruciating."" Appellees' App. 168. Herighty, Knoesel, and a sergeant together made the decision to arrest Marom. The third degree assault charge was reduced to second degree harassment the day after Marom's arrest; he proceeded to a bench trial and was acquitted of that charge.
Marom then filed this action. Concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity, the district court rejected Marom's arguments that the officers lacked even arguable probable cause to arrest him because (1) Salerno's injuries were insufficiently severe to support the third degree assault charge, and (2) his wife told police that Salerno had kicked him first. The district court also dismissed the claims against the Town.
""We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor."" Kuebel v. Black & Decker Inc., 643 F.3d 352, 358 (2d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is appropriate only if ""there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
The only issue before us is whether the district court correctly held that Herighty and Knoesel were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Marom's false arrest claim.[2] ""An officer is entitled to qualified immunity from a federal false arrest . . . claim if he had arguable probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for any offense, regardless of the offense with which the plaintiff was actually charged."" Kass v. City of N.Y., 864 F.3d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 2017). Probable cause exists when the officer is in ""possession of facts sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense."" Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 1997). Arguable probable cause exists when ""it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed, or officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met."" Kass, 864 F.3d at 206 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).
Marom argues that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him for third degree assault because Salerno, the victim, was not injured, as required by New York law. Under New York law, ""[a] person is guilty of assault in the third degree when . . . [w]ith intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person."" N.Y. Penal Law § 120.00. ""`Physical injury' means impairment of physical condition or substantial pain."" Id. § 10.00(9). ""[P]etty slaps, shoves, kicks and the like delivered out of hostility, meanness and similar motives constitute only harassment and not assault, because they do not inflict physical injury."" People v. Chiddick, 8 N.Y.3d 445, 448 (2007) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, ""[m]ere evidence of being struck and suffering a red mark or a black eye is insufficient for the crime of assault."" Malte v. State, 125 A.D.2d 958, 959 (4th Dep't 1986). Although it is undisputed that Marom slapped Salerno, Marom contends that, in light of the preceding legal principles, the slap was insufficient to constitute an assault.
However, Salerno complained to police of pain to her face and neck, and she described the pain as ""excruciating."" It is also undisputed that there were marks on Salerno's face that were observed by the arresting officers. In light of Salerno's characterization of the pain to the officers as ""excruciating,""—a description that officers could reasonably interpret as constituting ""substantial pain,"" N.Y. Penal Law § 10.00(9),—""it was objectively reasonable for the officer[s] to believe that probable cause existed"" with respect to the physical injury requirement, ""or officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met."" Kass, 864 F.3d at 206 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).
Marom also appears to argue that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him because his wife had told them that Salerno kicked Marom before he hit her, giving rise to a justification defense: self-defense. It is true that when making a probable cause determination, an officer may not ""deliberately disregard facts known to him which establish justification."" Jocks v. Tavernier, 316 F.3d 128, 136 (2d Cir. 2003). However, officers are not required ""to investigate exculpatory defenses offered by the person being arrested or to assess the credibility of unverified claims of justification before making an arrest."" Id. ""It is up to the factfinder to determine whether a defendant's story holds water, not the arresting officer."" Krause v. Bennett, 887 F.2d 362, 372 (2d Cir. 1989).
Drawing all reasonable inferences in Marom's favor, at the time of the arrest officers were aware that Salerno kicked Marom, and in response, Marom slapped Salerno in the face. Under New York law, force may be used in self-defense ""to the extent [that the one acting in self-defense] reasonably believes such [force] to be necessary to defend himself, herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person."" N.Y. Penal Law § 35.15(1). It is not clear from witness statements that Marom's response to Salerno's kick to his shin—slapping her in the face—was necessary to defend himself or another. Marom's slap could reasonably be viewed by the arresting officers as an unnecessary—and therefore unprivileged—act of retaliation. Since the officers were under no obligation ""to investigate exculpatory defenses offered by [Marom],"" Jocks, 316 F.3d at 136, and were entitled to allow the ""factfinder to determine whether [Marom's self-defense] story holds water,"" Krause, 887 F.2d at 372, Marom's statements that he acted in self-defense, even supported by his wife's statement that Salerno kicked him first, did not vitiate probable cause to arrest him. Accordingly, the district court was correct in concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.
We have considered all of Marom's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  Marom does not appeal from the district court's February 23, 2015 order, which dismissed all Defendants except for Herighty, Knoesel, and the Town, and all claims except for false arrest and malicious prosecution.
[2]  Even ""constru[ing] [Marom's] pro se appellate brief[] . . . liberally and interpret[ing] [it] to raise the strongest arguments [it] suggest[s],"" Wright v. C.I.R., 381 F.3d 41, 44 (2d Cir. 2004), we conclude that Marom does not challenge on appeal the dismissal of his claims against the Town, or the grant of summary judgment to Herighty and Knoesel on his malicious prosecution claim. Accordingly, he has abandoned any argument that either ruling was error. See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, 71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding, in the context of a pro se appeal, that issues not raised in an appellate brief are abandoned).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the Plaintiff-Appellant's motion to supplement the record on appeal is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.
Plaintiff-Appellant Jerry Geza Toth, proceeding pro se on behalf of his minor son T.T., appeals from a judgment of the district court dismissing his complaint as moot.
T.T. has autism. Pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (""IDEA""), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., Defendant-Appellant the New York City Department of Education (""the DOE"") prepared individualized education programs (""IEPs"") for T.T. Toth challenged T.T.'s 2013 IEP on the ground that it provided for insufficient Applied Behavior Analysis (""ABA"") therapy for T.T. because it recommended only ten hours of that therapy per week instead of fifteen hours. After Toth's claim was rejected by the State of New York administrative adjudicators, he filed a complaint in the district court seeking, inter alia, ""an award of compensatory ABA therapy."" J.A. 239.
The DOE moved to dismiss Toth's complaint. It argued in relevant part that Toth's claim was moot because the parties had entered into a resolution agreement in conjunction with Toth's challenge to a different IEP that required the DOE to provide T.T. with fifteen hours of ABA therapy per week. Toth opposed the DOE's motion, arguing that his claim fell within the exception to the mootness doctrine for claims capable of repetition yet evading review. See Nat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. Walsh, 714 F.3d 682, 692 (2d Cir. 2013). He also submitted a cross-motion seeking to file an amended complaint requesting injunctive relief ordering the DOE to provide T.T. with 1,000 hours of compensatory ABA therapy.
The district court referred the DOE's motion to a magistrate judge, who issued a report recommending that the DOE's motion to dismiss be granted and Toth's cross-motion be denied. With respect to the DOE's motion, the magistrate judge reasoned that the exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply because any ""concern that the DOE will . . . revert[] . . . to an IEP . . . with decreased at-home ABA therapy is mere speculation."" J.A. 402. The magistrate judge then determined that permitting Toth to amend his complaint to request 1,000 compensatory hours of ABA therapy would be futile because Toth's proposed amended complaint did not allege that T.T. would suffer irreparable harm as is required to obtain injunctive relief. The magistrate judge also noted that it was not even clear that it would be practical for T.T. to receive five additional hours of ABA therapy every day. Toth then objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, arguing as relevant here that the risk that the DOE would revert to a lower level of ABA therapy was not speculative.
The district court found Toth's objections to be meritless, and therefore adopted the report and recommendation, and granted the DOE's motion to dismiss and denied Toth's motion to amend. In so doing, the court noted that Toth had ""not argued that the most current IEP does not provide for 15 hours of at-home therapy."" J.A. 505.
Toth then filed this appeal, in which he argues that this case is not moot and that the district court erred when it declined to allow him to file his amended complaint seeking 1,000 hours of compensatory education. He has since moved to supplement the record on appeal with several documents, including a copy of T.T.'s most recent IEP, which apparently fails to recommend any ABA therapy and orders only three hours of individual therapy of any type per week.
We assume the parties' familiarity with the remaining facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal. We grant in part and deny in part Toth's motion to supplement the record, and vacate the judgment of the district court and remand.
I. Toth's Motion to Supplement the Record on Appeal
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(a)(1) provides that the record on appeal is generally comprised of (1) the ""papers and exhibits filed in the district court,"" (2) ""the transcript of the proceedings,"" and (3) ""a certified copy of the docket entries."" Fed. R. App. P. 10(a). We therefore do not consider evidence that was not part of the record below ""absent extraordinary circumstances."" Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Edelstein, 526 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir. 1975).
Such circumstances exist here with respect to T.T.'s most recent IEP. That IEP, unlike T.T.'s prior IEP, which is in the original record on appeal, does not require ABA therapy. Since both the magistrate judge and district court concluded that Toth's claim did not fall within the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine because Toth's claim that T.T.'s ABA therapy might be reduced was speculative, T.T.'s most recent IEP is relevant. We therefore grant Toth's motion as to T.T.'s IEP for the 2016-2017 school year.
We deny Toth's motion insofar as it seeks to add other documents to the record, however. Toth has not established relevance or importance as to any of those documents. There are therefore no extraordinary circumstances that warrant expanding the record to include those other documents.
II. The District Court's Conclusion that Toth's Claim Was Moot
We agree with Toth's contention that his claim is not moot.
""We review de novo the district court's conclusion that [a plaintiff's] claims are moot."" Cty. of Suffolk v. Sebelius, 605 F.3d 135, 139 (2d Cir. 2010).
""A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome."" Tann v. Bennett, 807 F.3d 51, 52 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""A party seeking to have a case dismissed as moot bears a heavy burden."" Lillbask ex rel. Mauclaire v. Conn. Dep't of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 84 (2d Cir. 2005). An exception to the mootness doctrine applies to ""cases capable of repetition, yet evading review."" Walsh, 714 F.3d at 692 (internal quotation marks omitted). More specifically, that exception ""applies where (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, both the magistrate judge and district court concluded that the first prong of the exception to the mootness doctrine was satisfied. They nevertheless concluded that the exception did not apply because they determined that the risk that the DOE would issue a new IEP that decreased T.T.'s ABA therapy was speculative. The fact that the DOE has now issued a new IEP that eliminates ABA therapy establishes that Toth's concern is no longer speculative. Indeed, the magistrate judge even recognized that if the DOE issued an IEP such as the one it now has, Toth's argument ""that the prior IEP would be repeated"" ""would no longer be mere speculation."" J.A. 402 n.4. The district court similarly noted that Toth had ""not argued that the most current IEP does not provide for 15 hours of at-home therapy."" J.A. 505. Both the magistrate judge and the district court therefore conditioned their mootness analysis on a factual situation that has materially changed. Thus, Toth's claim is no longer moot.
III. Toth's Motion to Amend His Complaint
In light of our conclusion that Toth's claim presents a live controversy, we need not consider Toth's argument regarding his amended complaint. The magistrate judge found that there were pleading deficiencies with Toth's proposed amended complaint such that it would be futile to grant him leave to file it. If, however, Toth rectifies those purported deficiencies and files a new motion to amend his complaint on remand that the district court grants, then his claim would not be moot for the additional reason that he seeks 1,000 hours of compensatory education. Compensatory education is a remedy ""`calculated to provide the educational benefits that likely would have accrued from special education services the school district should have supplied in the first place.'"" Doe v. East Lyme Bd. of Educ., 790 F.3d 440, 457 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Reid ex rel. Reid v. D.C., 401 F.3d 516, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2005)). As we observed in Lillbask, 397 F.3d at 89, ""several of our sister circuits have concluded that a claim for compensatory education or reimbursement can defeat a mootness challenge in an IEP placement dispute."" Thus, Toth would have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this litigation insofar as he seeks services to make up for a prior IEP's inadequacies. We therefore leave it to the district court to determine on remand whether Toth should be permitted to amend his complaint if he cures the deficiencies in his initial motion and files a new motion to amend his complaint.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART Toth's motion to supplement the record on appeal, VACATE the judgment of the district court, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this order.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DISMISSED.
Petitioner Nolberto Jimbo-Niola (""petitioner"" or ""Jimbo-Niola""), a native and citizen of Ecuador, seeks review of a March 7, 2017, decision of the BIA, granting reconsideration of an earlier BIA decision and affirming a March 11, 2016, decision of an immigration judge (""IJ"") ordering Jimbo-Niola removed to Ecuador. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.
DISCUSSION
We review both the IJ's decision and the BIA's second, reconsidered decision ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 2001) (when the BIA grants reconsideration it ""takes itself back in time and looks at the case as though a decision had never been entered.""). Our jurisdiction to review the denial of adjustment of status is limited to ""constitutional claims or questions of law,"" which we review de novo. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B), (D); Pierre v. Holder, 588 F.3d 767, 772 (2d Cir. 2009). In determining whether a petitioner raises a constitutional challenge or question of law, we must ""study the arguments asserted [and] . . . determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction."" Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir. 2006).
We do not have jurisdiction to consider Jimbo-Niola's petition because his arguments challenge the agency's discretionary decision regarding the weight of the equities in his case. See Guyadin v. Gonzales, 449 F.3d 465, 468 (2d Cir. 2006) (""An assertion that an IJ or the BIA misread, misunderstood, or misapplied the law in weighing factors relevant to the grant or denial of discretionary relief does not convert what is essentially an argument that the IJ and BIA abused their discretion into a legal question."").
Petitioner argues that the IJ did not act as a neutral factfinder because she too heavily weighed the severity of his arrests and convictions for driving while impaired by alcohol. Petitioner further argues that this mistake deprived him of due process, and that he thus raises a reviewable constitutional claim. This is not so. His argument concerns the weight given to the evidence of his prior convictions by the IJ, a factual decision that is not reviewable by the Court of Appeals. See Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship & Immig. Srvs., 437 F.3d 238, 244 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that an argument that an IJ incorrectly weighed the evidence is not a colorable constitutional claim).
Jimbo-Niola next argues that the IJ violated his right to due process a second time by failing to consider his employment and tax history, the consequences of removal for his family, or his character affidavits. This argument is meritless. Once again, petitioner attempts to characterize a dispute with the IJ's interpretation of the evidence as a constitutional violation. An agency makes an error of law when it ""totally overlook[s]"" or ""seriously mischaracterize[s]"" important facts relating to the discretionary determination. Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d 316, 323 (2d Cir. 2009) (determining that an IJ committed an error of law by failing to consider the health of a petitioner's U.S. citizen relative). But ""the agency does not commit an `error of law' every time an item of evidence is not explicitly considered or is described with imperfect accuracy."" Id. Nor is the IJ required to parse each piece of evidence; ""we presume that an IJ has taken into account all of the evidence before [her], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise."" Xiao Ji Chen, 471 F.3d at 342 n.17.
Petitioner has not shown that the IJ's treatment of the evidence in his case amounted to an error of law. The IJ summarized Jimbo-Niola's testimony, his tax and employment history, and the consequences of removal for his family. Although the IJ did not explicitly discuss all of these factors in the analysis section of its decision, the IJ found Jimbo-Niola credible and explicitly considered his 25 years of residence, his status as the sole financial supporter of his wife and U.S. citizen children, and the health problems of his family members. Although the IJ did not discuss the character affidavits, the record does not suggest that they were ignored, particularly as the IJ included them in the list of exhibits.
CONCLUSION
Because the IJ did not make an error of law, we cannot review Jimbo-Niola's challenges to the IJ's weighing of the evidence. We have reviewed all of petitioner's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.

WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.
Defendant Julian Brown appeals from a judgment of the Eastern District of New York (Donnelly, J.) entered August 4, 2016, convicting him of conspiracy to commit mail and health care benefits fraud and sentencing him to time served. Brown had pleaded guilty to those offenses on August 12, 2003. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Brown makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the charges against him or adjourn sentencing indefinitely due to the delay between his plea and sentencing. Although inordinate sentencing delay can violate the Due Process Clause, see United States v. Ray, 578 F.3d 184, 199 (2d Cir. 2009); see also Betterman v. Montana, 136 S. Ct. 1609, 1612 (2016), Brown's argument is without merit. When evaluating a defendant's claim that sentencing delay in his case was so extensive that his right to due process was violated, ""we `must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.'"" Ray, 578 F.3d at 199 (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 790 (1977)). Although ""a defendant does not bear the burden of seeking [his] own sentencing,"" id. at 191, ""[t]o the extent [he] seeks . . . to have [his] conviction vacated and the indictment dismissed, [his] failure, or [his] attorney's failure, to seek more prompt sentencing weighs heavily against [him],"" id. at 200. Brown, although in communication with his attorney throughout the delay, never requested sentencing, a fact weighing heavily against the remedy of dismissal. Also weighing against dismissal is Brown's failure to show prejudice resulting from the delay. Although he has shown that entry of a final judgment of conviction may cause him substantial harm, he has not demonstrated that imposing sentence now would be prejudicial ""in a way that the immediate imposition of sentence would not have [been]."" United States v. Paul, 634 F.3d 668, 675 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Ray, 578 F.3d at 201) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Brown next argues that the district court erred in calculating the loss attributable to his fraud. The loss amount calculation contained in the Pre-Sentence Report (""PSR"") was based on a series of loss claims for which there were no affidavits or supporting evidence. Declining to rely on the PSR's loss amount figure, the district court concluded that the amount of loss was $15,228, which was the amount Brown received for an insurance claim submitted on October 2, 2000 for a stolen vehicle. However, Brown did not admit to fraud regarding the stolen vehicle during his plea colloquy and the PSR states that the insurer was unable to demonstrate fraud as to this claim. The district court therefore erred by including the $15,228 amount in the loss calculation. See United States v. Ebbers, 458 F.3d 110, 128 (2d Cir. 2006) (explaining that ""loss must be the result of the fraud"" and that ""[l]osses from causes other than the fraud must be excluded from the loss calculation"").
The government argues that the error was harmless for two principal reasons. The government first contends that the error was harmless because the amount Brown gained from his participation in the scheme may be used as an alternate measure of loss, see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1 cmt. 3(B) (2015), and the actual loss measured in terms of Brown's gain was at least $15,228. As evidence of Brown's gain, the government cites an FBI report memorializing Brown's statement regarding payments he received as part of the scam. However, the FBI report appears not to clearly establish that Brown profited from the scheme in an amount equal to or greater than $15,228.
The government then argues that the error was harmless because even if the loss amount is determined to be less than $15,228 and results in a lower Guidelines range, Brown will still be sentenced to time served. We agree. See United States v. Jass, 569 F.3d 47, 68 (2d Cir. 2009).
However, the district court miscalculated the restitution award. It determined that the $15,228 that Brown received for the insurance claim for the stolen vehicle represented the total loss amount relevant to the restitution award determination. But because the $15,228 amount was not actual loss caused by the conduct comprising the offense of conviction, it does not reflect the appropriate amount of restitution. See United States v. Certified Envtl. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 103 (2d Cir. 2014).
Accordingly, we remand this matter to the district court for re-calculation of the restitution award.[1] On remand, the government is restricted in its ability to present new evidence of loss. ""[W]here the government knew of its obligation to present evidence [with respect to a restitution award] and failed to do so, it may not enter new evidence on remand."" United States v. Archer, 671 F.3d 149, 168 (2d Cir. 2011). However, this rule does not apply ""(a) where the government's burden was unclear, (b) where the trial court prohibited discussion of the issue, or (c) where the evidence was, for a good reason, unavailable."" Id. If the government wishes to introduce new evidence relating to restitution, it must first make a threshold showing that one of these exceptions is met, and the district court may then exercise its discretion in deciding whether to hear new evidence. Id.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's May 23, 2016 order denying Brown's due process claim, VACATE the restitution portion of Brown's sentence, and REMAND for recalculation of the restitution award.
[1]  While we remand this matter for re-calculation of the restitution award, since the restitution award was derived from the loss amount—with offsets for monies already paid—the corrected restitution amount (prior to offsets for monies already paid) would also constitute the corrected Guidelines loss amount.

A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Jill Meyer appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Weinstein, J.) dismissing her Complaint on summary judgment. Meyer alleges, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA""), 29 U.S.C. § 633a, that in 2012 she was not hired for a staff psychiatrist position at the New Jersey Veterans' Affairs Medical Center (the ""NJ VA"") because of her age and in retaliation for her protected Equal Employment Opportunity (""EEO"") activity. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Meyer, born in February 1953, was employed as a psychiatrist at the NJ VA from December 1994 until she voluntarily resigned in February 2004. During that time, she filed eight EEO complaints. She received her medical degree from the University of Dominica (Ross University), but has never been board-certified in any area of medicine. The NJ VA announced vacancies for a staff psychiatrist in 2011 and 2012; Meyer applied in 2011, and her application rolled over into the selection pool for the two vacancies available in 2012. The vacancy announcement did not specify that board certification was a requirement for the position, but the doctors on the NJ VA's selection panel determined, prior to reviewing applications, that they preferred board-certified candidates, whom they considered better qualified. Both board-certified and non-board-certified psychiatrists applied for the position; however, the selection panel chose to interview only board-certified applicants and hired two such psychiatrists aged 31 and 38.
Meyer filed an EEO Complaint with the VA alleging that her non-selection for the position was based on religion, age, and prior EEO activity. The VA EEO entered judgment in favor of the VA, which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission affirmed. This litigation ensued.
We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, VKK Corp. v. Nat'l Football League, 244 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001), ""view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, . . . draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of that party, and . . . eschew[ing] credibility assessments."" Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 122 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56.
We analyze ADEA claims for age discrimination and retaliation under the burden shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free School Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 2012). The plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case for age discrimination: ""(1) that she was within the protected age group, (2) that she was qualified for the position, (3) that she experienced adverse employment action, and (4) that the action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination."" Id. (quoting Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 107 (2d Cir. 2010)). To establish a prima facie case for retaliation under the ADEA, the plaintiff must show ""(1) participation in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action."" Id. (quoting Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir. 2005)). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for age discrimination or retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate ""a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason"" for the adverse employment action. Id. at 132 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If the defendant sustains that burden, the plaintiff must show that the proffered justification is pretextual. Id.
There is no basis to infer age discrimination from Meyer's failure to obtain the staff psychiatrist position: she fails to identify any evidence that the reason the NJ VA did not hire her was her age; and she offers no support for her assertion that the NJ VA's preference for board-certified physicians was mere pretext for discrimination. Meyer relies solely on the circumstances that the individuals hired were younger; but such conclusory allegations are insufficient to resist a motion for summary judgment. See Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp. 766 F.3d 163, 169-70 (2d Cir. 2014) (affirming summary judgment where employee failed to identify any admissible age-related evidence). Accordingly, Meyer has failed to sustain her burden to show a prima facie case of age discrimination.
Regarding the retaliation claim, Meyer has failed to show a causal connection between her ADEA protected activity and her non-selection for the position. A causal connection may be shown either ""(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant."" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 170 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, Meyer argues that she established temporal proximity because her application for the VA NJ staff psychiatrist position was the first opportunity presented to retaliate for her protected activities.
Temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action ""must be very close."" Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Meyer engaged in age-related protected activity when she filed an EEO complaint in 2003 that alleged (in part) age discrimination against the NJ VA. See Meyer v. McDonald, 241 F. Supp. 3d 379, 394-95 (E.D.N.Y. 2017).[1] Thus, approximately eight years elapsed between Meyer's EEO complaint and the claimed adverse employment action. Eight years is much too long an interval to support a plausible inference of causation. See, e.g., Breeden, 532 U.S. at 274 (""Action taken. . . 20 months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.""); Hollander v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 895 F.2d 80, 85-86 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that three-and-a-half month period between the complaint and the adverse action was insufficient to show ""causal nexus""). Furthermore, temporal proximity is not established simply because the NJ VA selection panel retaliated at the first opportunity; retaliation at the first opportunity is a valid consideration only if the temporal sequence is already close. See Summa v. Hofstra Univ., 708 F.3d 115, 128 (2d Cir. 2013). Meyer has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. We have considered Meyer's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without any merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
[1]  Meyer also engaged in protected ADEA activity when she filed an EEO complaint in 2009 alleging that the VA Medical Center in Syracuse, New York discriminated against her on the basis of age when it rescinded a conditional job offer. However, the district court ruled that the NJ VA selection panel had no knowledge of the 2009 complaint and that Meyer could not rely on ""mere corporate knowledge"" to establish a causal connection. Meyer, 241 F. Supp. 3d at 395 (citing Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 844 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2013). Meyer does not contest this holding on appeal.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
William Esrey and Ronald LeMay (""the plaintiffs"") appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Oetken, J.) dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction their complaint against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (""FTCA""), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671-80. On de novo review, we affirm. See Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
The FTCA's broad waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims against the government is subject to several exceptions. See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 851-52 (1984). As relevant here, the FTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for claims ""arising out of . . . misrepresentation."" 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). For purposes of this exception, ""a misrepresentation may result from the failure to provide information, as well as from [the] provi[sion] [of] information that is wrong."" Ingham v. E. Air Lines, Inc., 373 F.2d 227, 239 (2d Cir. 1967) (emphasis added). And the exception ""applies to claims arising out of negligent, as well as intentional, misrepresentation."" Block v. Neal, 460 U.S. 289, 295 (1983).
The plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), in violation of the laws of New York, aided and abetted Ernst & Young (""EY"") in breaching a fiduciary duty EY owed to the plaintiffs. Essentially, the plaintiffs claim that the IRS took steps to conceal from the plaintiffs the fact that EY was the subject of a criminal investigation that created a conflict of interest for EY in its representation of the plaintiffs in a civil audit before the IRS. The plaintiffs claim that they were injured by this concealment because, if they had known at the time of their audit that EY was under criminal investigation, they could have used that information to (1) convince their then-employer, an EY client that eventually terminated the plaintiffs over concerns arising from the audit, to instead terminate EY; and (2) pursue their arbitration claim against EY for fiduciary-duty breach in a more cost-effective manner.
""A plaintiff may not by artful pleading avoid [§ 2680(h) of the FTCA]."" Dorking Genetics v. United States, 76 F.3d 1261, 1265 (2d Cir. 1996). ""In determining the applicability of the § 2680(h) exception, a court must look, not to the theory upon which the plaintiff elects to proceed, but rather to the substance of the claim which he asserts."" Lambertson v. United States, 528 F.2d 441, 443 (2d Cir. 1976).
Although the plaintiffs style their claim as one for ""aiding and abetting a fiduciary-duty breach,"" the gravamen of that claim is that the IRS wrongfully withheld information from them. Indeed, in their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that they suffered their principal injuries because the ""IRS . . . helped EY to hide information"" and ""[a]s a result of . . . the IRS's active concealment"" of its criminal investigation and audit of EY's tax practices. App'x at 8-9. The alleged conduct that was ""essential"" to the plaintiffs' claimed injuries was the IRS's non-communication of information. Block, 460 U.S. at 297. Accordingly, the claim ""aris[es] out of . . . misrepresentation"" under 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h), and no court is statutorily accorded jurisdiction to hear it.
The plaintiffs attempt to evade the misrepresentation exception by identifying two ""non-concealment"" acts that they allege in their complaint. Appellant's Br. at 24. First, they point to allegations that the IRS removed the word ""penalty"" from a press release regarding the IRS's audit of EY. Second, the plaintiffs contend that the IRS's failure to prohibit EY from representing them in audit proceedings due to a conflict of interest was not an act involving a representation.
The plaintiffs' arguments are unavailing. As to the first argument, the allegation that the IRS decided to remove the word ""penalty"" amounts to an allegation that the IRS misrepresented to the public the nature of the IRS's concern with EY's tax shelter practices. This claim centers on the ""communication of information on which the recipient relies,"" and is therefore barred by the misrepresentation exception. Block, 460 U.S. at 296. Similarly, the plaintiffs' second argument fails, because the plaintiffs' theory is that by failing to prohibit EY from representing them, the ""IRS . . . helped EY to hide information from [the] Plaintiffs[,] knowing that such information would have been critical to [the] Plaintiffs' evaluation of whether to trust EY."" App'x at 8. This claim too concerns communicating information to the plaintiffs, and therefore the plaintiffs fail to allege ""the breach of a cognizable duty owed to [them] which is `distinct from any duty to use due care in communicating information.'"" Dorking Genetics, 76 F.3d at 1265 (quoting Block, 460 U.S. at 297).
We have considered the plaintiffs' remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Defendant-Appellant Kareem Martin appeals from a final judgment entered by the district court (Caproni, J.) on March 6, 2017, following a jury trial, sentencing him principally to 22 years' imprisonment for one count of narcotics conspiracy and one count of brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Martin challenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
""We review a sentence for . . . substantive reasonableness under a `deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.'"" United States v. Thavaraja, 740 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007)). We ""identif[y] as substantively unreasonable only those sentences that are so `shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law' that allowing them to stand would `damage the administration of justice.'"" United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 289 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2009)).
First, Martin argues that the district court failed to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between himself and his co-defendants, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). That is simply not the pertinent comparison, however, as ""we have repeatedly made clear that `section 3553(a)(6) requires a district court to consider nationwide sentence disparities, but does not require a district court to consider disparities between co-defendants.'"" United States v. Ghailani, 733 F.3d 29, 55 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. Frias, 521 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir. 2008)). Moreover, ""a disparity between non-similarly situated co-defendants is not a valid basis for a claim of error under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)."" United States v. Fernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 28 (2d Cir. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338 (2007). Here, Martin was not similarly situated to the co-defendants to whom he compares himself because they pleaded guilty, unlike Martin, and they were subordinate to Martin in their gang's hierarchy. See e.g., United States v. Kasi, 348 F. App'x 689, 692 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order) (""Kasi and his co-defendants were not similarly situated"" where ""Kasi was the only defendant to plead not guilty and proceed to trial"" and ""was more culpable than his co-defendants because he was the organizer and manager of the fraud scheme.""). Indeed, Tyrone Felder, Martin's co-defendant and the group's leader, received an even lengthier sentence.
Second, Martin contends that the sentence imposed is ""greater than necessary,"" Def. Br. 23, attacking the district court's ""fail[ure] to impose the mandatory minimum sentence,"" id. at 24. That argument is unavailing here, where the district court departed significantly downward from the Guidelines' sentencing range, which recommended a sentence at least 15 years longer than that actually imposed by the district court. See United States v. Perez-Frias, 636 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (""In the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances. It is therefore difficult to find that a below-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable."" (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted)).
Third, Martin asserts that the district court failed to adequately account for aspects of his personal history. ""The particular weight to be afforded to aggravating and mitigating factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge,"" however, and ""we are mindful that facts may frequently point in different directions so that even experienced district judges may reasonably differ, not only in their findings of fact, but in the relative weight they accord competing circumstances."" Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 289 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Having reviewed the record, we find that the district court properly considered Martin's ""unfortunate"" and ""tragic"" background, discussing how Martin ""grew up in an impoverished environment with no positive male role models,"" was ""failed by the New York City Public Schools,"" and was raised, in part, by ""a crack-driven father"" and ""crack-driven aunt."" App. 145-46. That the district court did not find those factors to outweigh the ""terrible"" nature of Martin's crimes and his ""incredibly violent"" history is not a proper basis for vacating his sentence. Id. at 146-47.
Lastly, Martin claims that he was improperly punished for exercising his right to a jury trial. As a preliminary matter, we note that this argument is premised on Martin's belief that he would have received a sentence of approximately five years' imprisonment if he had pleaded guilty, but he fails to point to anything in the record supporting that contested proposition. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring brief to contain ""appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies""). Even assuming arguendo that Martin is correct that he could have received a significantly shorter sentence if he had pled guilty, however, he has also failed to demonstrate that the actual sentence imposed was impermissible retaliation for his determination to go to trial, as opposed to a legitimate consequence of his own decision not to accept any plea agreement that may have been offered to him. See, e.g., Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559, 568 (1984) (""[D]ue process is not implicated when a prosecutor threatens to seek conviction on a greater offense if the defendant does not plead guilty and in fact does so when the defendant proceeds to trial,"" which is ""a mere by-product of the give-and-take negotiation common in plea bargaining."" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1202 (2d Cir. 1993) (rejecting similar argument when there was ""nothing to indicate that the court sought to penalize [a defendant] for exercising his right to put the government to its proof"" and ""the court stated several other weighty reasons for the sentence it selected"").
We have considered all of the defendant's arguments on this appeal and find in them no basis for vacatur. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

Plaintiff Kathleen McGuire-Welch appeals from an award of summary judgment in favor of defendants The House of the Good Shepherd (""HGS""), The House of the Good Shepherd's Tilton School (""the Tilton School""), the Tilton School Coordinator of Educational Services Shannon Perri, and HGS Assistant Executive Director Zygmunt Malowicki, on McGuire-Welch's claims of (1) age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA""), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; and the New York State Human Rights Law (""NYSHRL""), N.Y. Exec. Law § 296; and (2) retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (""Rehabilitation Act""), 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; and the NYSHRL. Specifically, McGuire-Welch claims she was terminated from her position as Committee for Special Education Chairperson at the Tilton School because of her age and in retaliation for her advocacy on behalf of disabled students.
We review an award of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in that party's favor. See Townsend v. Benjamin Enters., Inc., 679 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2012). We ""may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record."" Bruh v. Bessemer Venture Partners III L.P., 464 F.3d 202, 205 (2d Cir. 2006). In applying these principles here, we assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.
1. Age Discrimination Claims
Age discrimination claims brought under the ADEA and NYSHRL are governed by the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). See Kovaco v. Rockbestos-Surprenant Cable Corp., 834 F.3d 128, 136 (2d Cir. 2016); Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 434 (2d Cir. 2015). Under this framework, ""the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination."" Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp., 766 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to ""articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). If the defendant proffers such a reason, ""the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted and drops from the case,"" Kovaco v. Rockbestos-Surprenant Cable Corp., 834 F.3d at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted), and ""the plaintiff must prove that the employer's proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination,"" McPherson v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 457 F.3d 211, 215 (2d Cir. 2006), though ""the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's prima facie case and inferences properly drawn therefrom on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual,"" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). To carry her ADEA pretext burden, the plaintiff must prove age was the ""but-for"" cause of the challenged employment action, Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 106 (2d Cir. 2010), and we have assumed, without deciding, that this standard also applies to age discrimination claims under the NYSHRL, see id. at 105 n.6.[1]
The parties do not here dispute that McGuire-Welch made the de minimis showing necessary to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, or that defendants articulated a non-discriminatory reason for her termination, namely, poor performance and failure timely to complete tasks required by a Corrective Action Plan implemented to address issues identified by a New York State Education Department (""NYSED"") audit of the Tilton School. McGuire-Welch challenges only the district court's conclusion that she failed to adduce sufficient evidence of pretext.
First, McGuire-Welch argues that defendants have provided inconsistent explanations for her termination, stating both that she was terminated for failure timely to complete assignments in connection with the Corrective Action Plan and for sustained poor performance. This court has held that ""a jury issue on the question of pretext may be created when an employer offers inconsistent and varying explanations for its decision to terminate a plaintiff."" Roge v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 257 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir. 2001). There is no inconsistency, however, in the explanation here because, as Malowicki attested, McGuire-Welch was terminated due to ""her poor performance, [and] most particularly her failure to timely complete tasks in connection with the NYSED Audit and the Corrective Action Plan,"" App'x 43, and that failure was ""the final straw,"" App'x 599. See Roge v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 257 F.3d at 170 (identifying insufficient evidence of pretext to preclude summary judgment where employer's stated reasons were ""variations. . . on the same theme rather than separate inconsistent justifications""). While McGuire-Welch contends this poor performance explanation is not credible because her prior evaluations ""had all been positive,"" Appellant's Br. at 28, her 2010-11 evaluation by Perri's predecessor—although awarding somewhat higher ratings overall—notes some of the same performance issues subsequently cited by Perri, particularly as to the accuracy of McGuire-Welch's work and her planning abilities. And whether or not McGuire-Welch knew about the Corrective Action Plan itself, there is no genuine dispute that McGuire-Welch knew about the tasks she had been assigned under the Corrective Action Plan and failed timely to complete them.
Second, McGuire-Welch contends that defendants departed from their own policy in terminating her without first providing progressive discipline. While an inference of pretext may arise where an employer's deviation from its procedures results in the challenged employment decision, see Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 131 F.3d 305, 313-14 (2d Cir. 1997), the record here demonstrates no such deviation. HGS policy provides that ""[l]esser offenses will most likely involve discipline of a progressive nature,"" but ""[m]ore serious offenses may require immediate probation, suspension or discharge without recourse to less[e]r forms of corrective action."" App'x 696-97. Given record evidence that defendants considered McGuire-Welch's failure timely to complete tasks related to the Corrective Action Plan to be serious misconduct jeopardizing the Tilton School's educational certification, there was no policy deviation in her termination without lesser corrective action.
Third, although McGuire-Welch argues ""it was common knowledge"" that Perri had a list of older employees, including McGuire-Welch, whom she planned to terminate, Appellant's Br. at 23, McGuire-Welch adduces no admissible evidence to support this contention. While McGuire-Welch testified that certain co-workers told her Perri intended to terminate her—statements that constitute inadmissible hearsay in any event, see Rubens v. Mason, 387 F.3d 183, 188 (2d Cir. 2004)—none of these statements make any reference to age as the basis for any planned terminations. Nor is there record support—beyond McGuire-Welch's own conclusory assertions—for her argument that younger teachers received more positive reviews. See Davis v. New York, 316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002) (recognizing that ""reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion"").
Fourth, McGuire-Welch cites her testimony that, approximately three weeks after Perri became her supervisor in July 2011, Perri asked McGuire-Welch when she planned to retire. This lone comment, however—which occurred nearly two years before McGuire-Welch was terminated in June 2013—cannot bear the weight McGuire-Welch assigns it. See Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 468 (2d Cir. 2001) (recognizing that ""stray remarks of a decision-maker"" are insufficient to prove an employment discrimination claim).
Fifth, McGuire-Welch—who was 60 at the time of her termination—points to her replacement by a 29-year-old. While this court has recognized that replacement by a significantly younger employee can give rise to an inference of discrimination, see Carlton v. Mystic Transp., Inc., 202 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir. 2000), we have also stated that ""a disparity in the ages of a[] . . . plaintiff and her replacement . . . will not, by itself, always suffice"" to show an employer's proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination, Banks v. Travelers Cos., 180 F.3d 358, 367 (2d Cir. 1999). That is the case here. Moreover, although McGuire-Welch suggests that her younger replacement had less experience, she produces no evidence that her replacement was unqualified.
Finally, to the extent McGuire-Welch complains generally that Perri was antagonistic toward her, such claims of unfair treatment do not satisfy her burden to show unlawful age discrimination. See Grillo v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 291 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2002) (upholding summary judgment award to defendant where, even crediting plaintiff's claim that ""he was unfairly singled out for punishment,"" plaintiff did not establish such treatment was due to a discriminatory motive); Norton v. Sam's Club, 145 F.3d 114, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (recognizing that anti-discrimination law ""does not make employers liable for doing stupid or even wicked things"" but only ""for discriminating, for firing people on account of their age"" (emphasis in original)).
In sum, because McGuire-Welch failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show that defendants' articulated reason for her termination was a pretext for age discrimination, defendants were entitled to summary judgment on her discrimination claims. See Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d at 470 (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant where plaintiffs ""met their de minimis burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination,"" but ""failed to produce sufficient evidence to support a rational finding that the non-discriminatory . . . reasons proffered by the defendant for the challenged employment actions were false"").
2. Retaliation Claims
Retaliation claims under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and NYSHRL are also governed by the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Widomski v. State Univ. of N.Y. (SUNY) at Orange, 748 F.3d 471, 476 (2d Cir. 2014); Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 843 (2d Cir. 2013); Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002). To carry her prima facie burden, McGuire-Welch had to show that (1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) the employer was aware of this activity, (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (4) a causal connection existed between the adverse employment action and her protected activity. See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2002). Defendants then had to proffer a non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action, whereupon the burden shifted back to McGuire-Welch to show that reason was pretextual. See Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d at 721.
McGuire-Welch challenges the district court's determination that she failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support her retaliation claims, arguing that a rational trier of fact could find she was terminated for advocating on behalf of disabled students. We disagree.
McGuire-Welch argues on appeal primarily that Perri was improperly concerned with ""protect[ing] the image of the Tilton School over the special educational needs of its disabled students,"" while McGuire-Welch, in contrast, was committed to meeting such students' needs. Appellant's Br. at 34. Even assuming that Perri, unlike McGuire-Welch, failed to prioritize the needs of disabled students, McGuire-Welch does not explain how such facts, by themselves, would support an inference of retaliatory discharge.
McGuire-Welch points to her testimony that, shortly before being terminated, she told another employee, Mary Palmer, that a student who had been released from jail should be allowed to take an exam, but that Palmer informed McGuire-Welch that Perri decided ""`the student was not in the right frame of mind' to take the test."" App'x 633 McGuire-Welch adduces no evidence, however, that defendants could have reasonably understood the opinion she expressed to Palmer as protesting or opposing unlawful disability discrimination. See Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro & Assocs. Consulting Eng'rs, P.C., 716 F.3d 10, 15 (2d Cir. 2013); Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat'l Realty & Dev. Corp., 136 F.3d 276, 292 (2d Cir. 1998). Notably, McGuire-Welch does not suggest, much less offer evidence, that she made any complaint or took any other action following Perri's contrary test decision. Her affidavit states simply that she told the student's teacher ""it was Defendant Perri's decision and there was nothing [she] could do about it."" App'x 634. Accordingly, McGuire-Welch's statement to Palmer that the student should be permitted to take the test does not qualify as protected activity giving rise to a claim of retaliation.
In sum, because McGuire-Welch failed to adduce sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, defendants were entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
3. Conclusion
We have considered McGuire-Welch's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the award of summary judgment in favor of defendants is AFFIRMED.
[1]  We need not here resolve the issue, because, even if we applied the lower Title VII standard and required only that age was a ""motivating factor,"" see Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Israel of the City of N.Y., 867 F.3d 298, 304 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted), we would still conclude McGuire-Welch's NYSHRL age discrimination claim fails.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Hu Cao, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a November 4, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming an October 30, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Cao's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Hu Cao, No. A206 068 543 (B.I.A. Nov. 4, 2016), aff'g No. A206 068 543 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 30, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as modified and supplemented by the BIA. Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005); Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008).
""Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on . . . the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements . . ., the internal consistency of each such statement, [and] the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record . . . without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64. Substantial evidence supports the agency's determination that Cao was not credible as to his claims that Chinese officials had harassed him and forced him into hiding after expropriating and destroying his farm, and that they had threatened to arrest him after discovering his membership in the China Democracy Party (""CDP"") in the United States.
The agency reasonably found Cao's testimony that officials had harassed him daily and caused him to live in hiding for a year inconsistent with his wife's letter, which omitted any mention of these events even though she claimed to write to inform the IJ how the Chinese government had threatened and persecuted her husband. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3 (relying on omissions from supporting letters and noting that ""[a]n inconsistency and an omission are . . . functionally equivalent.""). Cao did not provide a compelling explanation for this inconsistency. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore, the agency reasonably relied on Cao's failure to provide any evidence to corroborate this claim, or even establish that he had owned a farm in China. See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (""An applicant's failure to corroborate his . . . testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question."").
The agency also reasonably relied on an inconsistency between [i] Cao's testimony that he had informed his witness, the chairman of the East Coast CDP, that Chinese officials had discovered his membership in the CDP and threatened to arrest him, and [ii] the chairman's affidavit, which omitted this information. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3. Furthermore, the chairman's testimony did not resolve this inconsistency. Rather than state that he did not know if Chinese officials were aware of Cao's CDP activities, the chairman testified evasively, ultimately suggesting that officials ""should know"" because it was common sense. Only after being asked a third time whether Cao had concerns that the government was aware of his activities did the chairman state that he did not remember Cao's specific situation given the large number of CDP members. The agency was not compelled to credit this explanation because the chairman, who had testified in at least 100 asylum cases, remembered more detailed information about Cao, such as the month they had met and the day Cao had joined the party. See Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80.
Given the inconsistencies and the lack of corroboration relating both to past events in China and the Chinese government's purported discovery of Cao's CDP membership in the United States, the agency's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
We do not consider the BIA's decision insofar as it declined to remand based on the evidence Cao submitted on appeal because Cao does not challenge that decision in his brief. See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, 426 F.3d 540, 541 n.1, 545 n.7 (2d Cir. 2005).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioners Satpal Singh Mullar (""Mullar""), Jaspal Kaur Mullar, and Sukhkirandeep Singh Mullar, natives and citizens of India, seek review of a September 19, 2016, decision of the BIA denying their motion to reopen. In re Satpal Singh Mullar, Jaspal Kaur Mullar, Sukhkirandeep Singh Mullar, Nos. A 087 445 586/587/588 (B.I.A. Sept. 19, 2016). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
We review the BIA's decision for abuse of discretion. Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006). ""An abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the Board's decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements."" Kaur v. BIA, 413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the BIA's factual findings about country conditions for substantial evidence. Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir. 2008).
It is undisputed that Mullar's motion to reopen, filed almost three years after the final administrative decision was rendered, was untimely. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (setting 90-day deadline for reopening); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (same). This time limitation may be excused if the motion is filed to apply for asylum ""based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceedings."" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Mullar presses changed conditions for Sikhs since his 2011 merits hearing. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); In re S----Y----G----, 24 I. & N. Dec. 247, 253 (B.I.A. 2007) (the agency ""compare[s] the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below"").
The BIA was within its discretion to find that Mullar's new evidence did not excuse his untimely motion to reopen. The BIA cited evidence from the 2011 merits hearing that showed both Indian security forces killing demonstrators at protests and Sikhs disproportionately suffering from state violence. Consequently, Mullar's new evidence—about violent Sikh protests—did not reflect a material change in conditions.
Mullar attempts to distinguish the two sets of evidence: the 2011 record described a deadly confrontation that did not involve Sikhs. But the BIA had the discretion to find that the two sets of evidence are of a piece: the Indian government does not tolerate protest, irrespective of who is protesting.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Sheila Morris appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York affirming the Commissioner's denial of her application for Supplemental Social Security disability income. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Sheila Morris filed a Title XVI application for supplemental security income in September 2011 alleging disability since June 1, 2008. The application was denied, and Morris requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (""ALJ""). Appearing pro se, Morris submitted testimony and documentation about her condition and capacity at the February 2013 hearing. The ALJ also consulted the medical opinion and notes of Morris's treating physician, Dr. Ellis Gomez, in addition to treatment records from a geriatrician, a specialist in physiatry and rehabilitation, and a neurologist, as summarized below.
These treatment records show that Morris suffers from hypertension, hypothyroidism, and sporadic pain in her hands, feet, neck, and back. In a March 14, 2011 employability assessment, Morris was diagnosed with hypertension, hypothyroidism, and swelling in her ankles and forearms; it was recommended that she not work for three months. Later that year, Morris' treating physician Dr. Gomez diagnosed obesity, high cholesterol, and mild plantar fasciitis in the ankles, but otherwise normal extremities. Dr. Gomez's August 30, 2011 employability assessment noted the same set of conditions, and opined that Morris was moderately limited in walking, standing, sitting, lifting, pushing, and climbing. A November 22, 2011 physical exam and diagnosis by Dr. Gautam Arora detected the same conditions in addition to chronic pain, but only identified mild limitations in physical movement. These diagnoses revealed no limitation in mental function limitations and no limitation in seeing, hearing, speaking, or the use of hands. In February 2012, after Morris complained of pain and numbness in her hands and forearms, Morris saw Dr. Jeannie Koenig, a neurologist, who diagnosed moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.
On June 26, 2012, Dr. Gomez completed another functional capacity assessment, this time opining that Morris was ""moderately limited"" due to impairments in all areas of physical functioning and most areas of mental functioning, including: understanding and carrying out instructions; making simple decisions; interacting appropriately with others; maintaining socially appropriate behavior; and functioning in a work setting. As a result, Dr. Gomez concluded that Morris would not be able to work. Beforethe ALJ, Morris was not able to name her medical conditions, but she testified that: she had a ninth-grade special education; she had never worked full time; and she could not work due to trouble with her feet, legs, and arms.
To be disabled under the Social Security Act (""Act""), a claimant must establish an ""inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months."" 20 C.F.R. § 404.1505(a). The Commissioner engages in a five-step process to determine disability status, with the burden resting on the claimant for the first four steps and on the Commissioner for the fifth. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(4); see also Burgess v. Astrue, 537 F.3d 117, 128 (2d Cir. 2008). The ALJ found that the medical record evinced ""severe impairments,"" but determined that Morris retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work, with certain limitations, and that the Commissioner had proven that such work existed in significant numbers in the national economy. The ALJ therefore denied Morris' application, ruling that she was not under a ""disability"" within the meaning of the Act.
Morris alleges that she did not receive a full and fair hearing because the ALJ failed to develop the record with a complete medical history, particularly in light of her pro se status. Morris also argues that the ALJ inappropriately discounted the June 26, 2012 medical opinion of Morris' treating physician, Dr. Gomez, that Morris was unable to work. The district court found that the ALJ fulfilled the duty to develop the record and that the ALJ's determination was supported by substantial evidence. The Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted.
Our review of the denial of disability benefits ""focus[es] on the administrative ruling rather than the district court's opinion."" Moran v. Astrue, 569 F.3d 108, 112 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The threshold question is whether the claimant received a full and fair hearing. ""[T]he social security ALJ, unlike a judge in a trial, must on behalf of all claimants . . . affirmatively develop the record in light of the essentially non-adversarial nature of a benefits proceeding."" Lamay v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 562 F.3d 503, 508-09 (2d Cir. 2009) (citations and alterations omitted); see also Butts v. Barnhart, 388 F.3d 377, 386 (2d Cir. 2004) (""It is the ALJ's duty to investigate and develop the facts and develop the arguments both for and against the granting of benefits."") (citations and alterations omitted). Failure to develop the record warrants remand. See Rosa v. Callahan, 168 F.3d 72, 79-80 (2d Cir. 1999); Moran, 569 F.3d at 113-15 (vacating and remanding for ""perfunctory"" efforts by the ALJ to develop the record).
This duty is heightened for a pro se claimant. See Moran, 569 F.3d at 113; Cruz v. Sullivan, 912 F.2d 8, 11 (2d Cir. 1990). When a disability benefits claimant appears pro se, the ALJ must ""ensur[e] that all of the relevant facts are sufficiently developed and considered."" Cruz, 912 F.2d at 11 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Further, an ALJ ""cannot reject a treating physician's diagnosis without first attempting to fill any clear gaps in the administrative record."" Rosa, 168 F.3d at 79.
Morris contends that the record was deficient because the ALJ discounted the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Gomez, and that gaps remained in the administrative record, in particular, missing treatment notes. Dr. Gomez did receive requests for documents from the Social Security Administration, to which she responded with treatment records for Morris through April 2012. Additionally, at the hearing, Morris provided the ALJ with supplemental records from Dr. Gomez including a functional capacity assessment dated June 21, 2012, progress notes dated December 31, 2012, and correspondence between Dr. Gomez and other treating physicians. Morris argues, however, that the ALJ had a duty to recontact Dr. Gomez to obtain any outstanding records or clarification as of February 2013 before discarding his opinion. See Rosa, 168 F.3d at 80; Selian v. Astrue, 708 F.3d 409, 420-21 (2d Cir. 2013).
The appellant urges that three missing records may exist that bear on Dr. Gomez's ""moderately limited"" opinion. But that theoretical possibility does not establish that the ALJ failed to develop a complete record. It is at best disputed whether these records offer the salient corroboration to Dr. Gomez's June 26, 2012 diagnosis argued by the appellant. As the Government points out, there is no evidence that the alleged appointments were held or that the corresponding records exist. And Morris has no information about their contents.
Moreover, many of the recommendations made in Dr. Gomez's June 26, 2012 opinion are contradicted by his own August 30, 2011 opinion, which noted that Morris had no mental deficiencies. Dr. Gomez consistently found relatively mild limitation related to his patient's obesity, hands, and feet, none of which supported the wide-ranging and extreme functional limitations identified in his assessment affecting areas such as speech, socialization, and attention span. The duty to recontact arises only if the ALJ lacks sufficient evidence in the record to evaluate the doctor's findings, not when the treating physician's opinion is inconsistent with her own prior opinions and the rest of the record. See Guillen v. Berryhill, 697 F. App'x 107, 108 (2d Cir. 2017)(summary order)(citing Rosa, 168 F.3d at 79 n.5)); see also Rebull v. Massanari, 240 F. Supp. 2d 265, 272 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).
Morris responds that the missing treatment notes would show that her condition deteriorated significantly between August 2011 and June 2012; but this is dubious, especially considering the addition of previously undiagnosed social and cognitive handicaps. Further, the ALJ already possessed records from Dr. Gomez spanning May 2011 to December 2012, in addition to numerous assessments and notes from other physicians that cover each possible impairment, none of which corroborate the physical and mental limitations listed in the June 26, 2012 opinion. See Carvey v. Astrue, 380 F. App'x 50, 51 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order)(""[B]ecause the record evidence was adequate to permit the ALJ to make a disability determination, we identify no merit in [the] claim that the ALJ was obligated sua sponte to recontact the treating physician[]."").
Morris relies on Lopez v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. to illustrate that the omission of even one treatment source for a pro se claimant requires remand. 622 F. App'x 59 (2d Cir. 2015). In Lopez, a summary order, the claimant stated at her hearing that she had been ""hospitalized for four days"" due to back pain, but the hospitalization did not appear in the administrative record. Id. at 61. The court concluded that the absence of the hospital stay ""creat[ed] an obvious gap in the record"" and remanded for the ALJ to further develop the record. Id. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (citing Rosa, 168 F.3d at 79 n. 5). But an overnight hospital stay is likely to be a serious and critical medical event that could materially change the weight of the evidence on the disability determination; the potentially missing records here would consist of routine check-up and progress notes, with no indication that they contain significant information. It is not even clear that any records are actually missing.
With a sufficient administrative record, we review ""de novo to determine whether there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner's decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard."" Zabala v. Astrue, 595 F.3d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). Substantial evidence ""means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."" Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). If there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner's decision, it must be upheld. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g); see also Moran, 569 F.3d at 112.
Morris argues that the ALJ's disability decision is not supported by substantial evidence because it insufficiently credits the medical opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Gomez.
Under the Treating Physician Rule, the ""opinion of a treating physician is given controlling weight if it is well supported by medical findings and not inconsistent with other substantial evidence."" Rosa, 168 F.3d at 78-79; see also Burgess v. Astrue, 537 F.3d 117, 128 (2d Cir. 2008). But the opinion of a treating physician is not absolute. See Halloran v. Barnhart, 362 F.3d 28, 32 (2d Cir. 2004); cf. Minix v. Chater, No. 95CIV.8410(SAS), 1996 WL 435164, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 1996). As explained above, Dr. Gomez's June 2012 opinion was not supported by his diagnoses; conflicted with his earlier August 30, 2011 assessment; and painted a graver picture of Morris' health than any of Morris' consulting physicians' assessments could support. In the event of such a conflict, ""we defer to the Commissioner's resolution of conflicting evidence,"" Cage v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 692 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir. 2012), and reject the ALJ's findings ""only if a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude otherwise."" Brault v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm'r, 683 F.3d 443, 448 (2d Cir. 2012)(emphasis in original)(citation omitted). Rejecting Dr. Gomez's opinion here in favor of contrary evidence was a proper exercise of discretion. See Veino v. Barnhart, 312 F.3d 578, 588-89 (2d Cir. 2002).
Aside from the discounted opinion of Dr. Gomez, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's determination that Morris is not disabled and can perform work available in the national economy with certain limitations. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920(f); Talavera v. Astrue, 697 F.3d 145, 151, 153 (2d Cir. 2012).
For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in MORRIS's remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the Defendant-Appellant's sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing consistent with this order.
Defendant-Appellant Naquan Reyes appeals from the district court's judgment sentencing him to life imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of obstruction of justice murder in the second degree.[1] Specifically, from 2008 until his arrest in 2014, Reyes was a leader and recruiter in a bank fraud conspiracy in which he, as a teller at several retail banks in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, New York, created counterfeit checks, paid other individuals to deposit those checks into their accounts, and instructed those individuals to then immediately withdraw the funds before the fraud was detected.
Nicole Thompson, one of the individuals recruited by Reyes to participate in the fraudulent scheme, was arrested in July 2010. Thompson began to cooperate with authorities and identified Reyes as the person who provided her with the counterfeit checks. Shortly thereafter, Thompson received threatening text messages from Reyes concerning her cooperation, and just days later, she was murdered by strangulation in Brooklyn. Authorities discovered her body in a dumpster in Landover, Maryland.
In pleading guilty, Reyes admitted that he and his coconspirators paid an individual to murder Thompson in order to prevent her from cooperating in the investigation of the bank fraud scheme, and Reyes also acknowledged that he transported Thompson's body from New York and disposed of it in Maryland. Reyes maintained, however, that he did not personally murder Thompson and that he was not present when she was killed. But during a recorded conversation with a confidential source (""CS"") in February 2014, Reyes made several incriminating statements concerning Thompson's murder. For example, in response to a question from the CS as to why Reyes did not have a lookout ""do it,"" Reyes stated ""[t]hey want[ed] to, but it was too sloppy. I just did it myself. I just felt it was personal. So I just did it."" J.A. 201. Reyes also stated ""[unintelligible] do it again if my life was on the line. It was either me or her. That's how . . . I look at it."" J.A. 202.
During Reyes's sentencing hearing, his counsel withdrew a previously raised objection to a two-level Guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. Therefore, Reyes's acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 remained the only outstanding issue under the Guidelines, and the district court listened to Reyes's recorded conversation with the CS during the hearing to evaluate his ""history and characteristics . . . and whether or not he's credible in the statements that he has made to the [c]ourt and in [his] letter . . . to the [c]ourt."" J.A. 219; see also J.A. 222. In response, Reyes elected to testify in order to explain certain statements that he made during the recorded conversation; among other things, he testified that he was not present when Thompson was murdered—an issue that the Government declined to contest. Nevertheless, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Reyes was present during Thompson's murder, and that he therefore committed perjury. As a result, the district court withheld one offense-level point for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), despite the Government's position in Reyes's plea agreement and during sentencing that a full three-level reduction was warranted. With the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice and without the final one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Reyes's Guidelines range was life imprisonment,[2] and the district court sentenced him accordingly.
On appeal, Reyes challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his life sentence, and he also contends that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during sentencing by withdrawing his objection to the enhancement for obstruction of justice. We assume the parties' familiarity with the remaining facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
I. Procedural Reasonableness
""Our review of criminal sentences includes both procedural and substantive components and amounts to review for abuse of discretion."" United States v. McIntosh, 753 F.3d 388, 393-94 (2d Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a sentence, first ""we scrutinize whether the [d]istrict [c]ourt has committed significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence."" United States v. Bennett, 839 F.3d 153, 158-59 (2d Cir. 2016) (alterations omitted).
Reyes contends that the district court committed two procedural errors in imposing his life sentence. First, he argues that the district court imposed an unwarranted two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. Second, he contends that the district court erroneously awarded him only a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, rather than the full three-level reduction that the Government agreed he should receive under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.
A. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice
During sentencing, Reyes withdrew his objection to the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. Accordingly, we review this alleged procedural sentencing defect only for plain error. See United States v. Stevenson, 834 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir. 2016). ""Plain error review requires a defendant to demonstrate that (1) there was error, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error prejudicially affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."" United States v. Burden, 860 F.3d 45, 53 (2d Cir. 2017) (per curiam). Reyes asserts that the district court based the obstruction-of-justice enhancement on a clearly erroneous factual finding—that during a recorded phone call from prison, Reyes coerced his ex-girlfriend and eventual co-defendant Randie Tyson to lie to authorities about Thompson's murder. Specifically, Reyes contends that he never expressly asked Tyson to lie to authorities about Thompson's murder. ""The district court's factual findings at sentencing need be supported only by a preponderance of the evidence,"" and ""[t]o hold that a factual finding is clearly erroneous, we must be left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."" United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 124 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Reyes's argument is unavailing under the plain error standard for two reasons.
First, based on the plain language of Reyes's directions to Tyson during their recorded August 20, 2014 prison telephone call, it was permissible for the district court to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Reyes willfully impeded the investigation into Thompson's murder by encouraging Tyson to lie, or at the very least, providing her information that she had no reason to know with a goal of having her convey that information to authorities. See U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(A) (2015) (stating that covered conduct includes ""otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant [or] witness . . . directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so""). This finding is also supported by the reasonable inference that Reyes attempted to conceal from investigators his phone calls to Tyson by (i) using another inmate's phone pin number to place one call and (ii) referring to Tyson as ""Tamika"" on another call. Although the district court did not make an explicit factual finding during sentencing concerning these calls—because Reyes withdrew his objection—it accepted the PSR's factual findings (except for the section concerning acceptance of responsibility), including the ""reasonably detailed findings"" concerning the calls with Tyson. See United States v. Thompson, 808 F.3d 190, 195 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (noting that a district court may rely on the PSR to impose an obstruction-of-justice enhancement ""if the PSR sets forth reasonably detailed findings in support of its conclusions"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Upon review of the PSR's detailed factual findings concerning the obstruction enhancement, which were adopted by the district court, we are not left with a ""definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 124.
Second, even assuming arguendo that Reyes's calls with Tyson did not support a finding necessary to apply the enhancement for obstruction of justice, Reyes cannot satisfy the third prong of plain error review because the enhancement applied due to another reason. The district court found that Reyes committed perjury while testifying during his sentencing—a separate justification for the enhancement—and for the reasons explained in Part I.B.1 infra, that finding is not clearly erroneous. See U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(B), (F) (2015); see also United States v. McLeod, 251 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2001) (""Among the circumstances for a two-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice is committing perjury, or providing materially false information to a judge, during sentencing."").
Accordingly, we conclude that Reyes's arguments are insufficient under plain error review to disturb the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.
B. Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility
Reyes argues that the district court committed two procedural errors—one factual and one legal—in applying only a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. As to his factual argument, he contends that the district court relied on a clearly erroneous finding—that Reyes was present during Thompson's murder[3]—in concluding that he lied during his sentencing testimony and was therefore ineligible for a full three-level reduction. As to his legal argument, he contends that the district court had no authority to withhold the final one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b).
1. The District Court's Factual Finding
We conclude that the district court did not make a clearly erroneous factual finding (that Reyes was present during Thompson's murder) in concluding that Reyes lied during his sentencing testimony. Based solely on the self-incriminating statements Reyes made to the CS, at a time when he had no motive to lie, the district court's finding was a ""permissible view[] of the evidence,"" and therefore ""cannot be clearly erroneous."" See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 124.[4] We also identify no error in the district court's finding that Reyes's explanation of these statements during sentencing was ""incredible."" J.A. 245; see United States v. Delacruz, 862 F.3d 163, 176 (2d Cir. 2017) (""The ability of the district judge—who has seen and heard the witness—to make credibility determinations is superior to that of the appellate court."").
2. The District Court's Authority under § 3E1.1(b)
We acknowledge that ""[a] sentencing court's decision to grant or deny a § 3E1.1 reduction depends, in large part, on that [c]ourt's determination of the credibility of the defendant, and this determination should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation."" United States v. Jeffers, 329 F.3d 94, 102 (2d Cir. 2003) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Reyes, 9 F.3d 275, 280 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting that acceptance of responsibility is generally a ""factual question"" and that ""[w]ith the defendant before [it], the [district court] is unquestionably in a better position to assess contrition and candor than is an appellate court""). Nevertheless, the district court committed a legal error in withholding a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility that warrants resentencing.
Section 3E1.1 of the Guidelines provides, in two subsections, up to a three-level reduction of a defendant's combined offense level for acceptance of responsibility. United States v. Leung, 360 F.3d 62, 70 (2d Cir. 2004). The 2015 Guidelines manual, which controls Reyes's appeal because he was sentenced in July 2016, provides:
(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.
(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.
U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 (2015). As Reyes contends, subsection (b)—in contrast to subsection (a)—is not discretionary if its three requirements are satisfied. See Leung, 360 F.3d at 70. In other words, if (i) the defendant qualifies under subsection (a) for a two-level reduction, (ii) the defendant's offense level is 16 or greater, and (iii) the Government moves for a further one-level credit, the district court has no discretion to deny the final one-level reduction. See United States v. Rood, 281 F.3d 353, 357 (2d Cir. 2002) (""[G]ranting the additional one-level decrease in Section 3E1.1(b) is not discretionary where [the] defendant satisfies the [G]uideline's criteria.""); see also United States v. Mount, 675 F.3d 1052, 1055-59 (7th Cir. 2012) (explaining why subsection (b) is mandatory if the underlying criteria are satisfied even post-2003 amendment requiring Government motion).
The district court explained its decision to award only a two-level reduction under § 3E1.1 as follows: ""I am prepared to, based upon the agreement of the parties, to give [Reyes] a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and I'm not adding a third level because I believe [he] committed perjury on the stand when he testified today."" J.A. 248. Although the record is less than clear, the most natural interpretation of this ruling is that the district court granted a two-level reduction under subsection (a), but concluded it had discretion to deny the final one-level reduction under subsection (b). That is procedural error that warrants vacatur because a district court has no discretion to deny a one-level reduction if, as the district court's ruling here suggests, the requirements of subsection (b) are satisfied. See Rood, 281 F.3d at 357; see also Leung, 360 F.3d at 70. Furthermore, the district court never inquired whether the Government formally moved for the one-level reduction—one of the three necessary predicates under subsection (b)—even though the Government consistently stated that Reyes deserved the full three-level reduction under § 3E1.1 (including subsequent to his testimony during sentencing).[5]
Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not base its decision to withhold the full three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility on a clearly erroneous factual finding. But it did commit a legal error in concluding it had discretion to deny a one-level reduction under § 3E1.1(b). It appears that the district court awarded Reyes a two-level reduction under § 3E1.1(a), even though the PSR recommended that the court not grant Reyes any reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt. n.4. Therefore, we vacate and remand to allow the district court to make the pertinent findings under § 3E1.1(b) and to determine whether Reyes qualifies for the final one-level reduction. See Leung, 360 F.3d at 70.
II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Substantive Reasonableness
Reyes contends that his counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during sentencing by initially withdrawing, and then failing to renew, his objection to the enhancement for obstruction of justice. ""When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised on direct appeal, we may: (1) decline to hear the claim, permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255; (2) remand the claim to the district court for necessary factfinding; or (3) decide the claim on the record before us."" United States v. Kimber, 777 F.3d 553, 562 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).
""[I]n most cases a motion brought under § 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance."" Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504 (2003). We are ""generally disinclined to resolve ineffective assistance claims on direct review,"" United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 467 (2d Cir. 2004), and neither Reyes nor the Government provides us with a compelling reason to divert from this ""baseline aversion"" under the circumstances, United States v. Khedr, 343 F.3d 96, 99 (2d Cir. 2003). ""Among the reasons for this preference is that the allegedly ineffective attorney should generally be given the opportunity to explain the conduct at issue,"" id. at 100, especially where, as the Government contends here, the purportedly deficient performance (withdrawal of the objection to the enhancement) may have been a strategic choice by Reyes's counsel. We therefore decline to consider Reyes's challenge based on ineffective assistance of counsel in favor of its resolution, if necessary, on collateral review.
Finally, Reyes contends that his life sentence is substantively unreasonable. We need not address this argument because the procedural error as to acceptance of responsibility warrants resentencing. See United States v. Tutty, 612 F.3d 128, 131 (2d Cir. 2010). Accordingly, we indicate no view on the substantive reasonableness of a life sentence under the circumstances, even if Reyes's Guidelines range is lowered by the final one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility on remand.[6]
* * *
We have considered Reyes's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we VACATE Reyes's sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this order.
[1]  The district court imposed concurrent sentences of thirty years' imprisonment for the conspiracy to commit bank fraud conviction and life imprisonment for the obstruction of justice murder conviction.
[2]  Reyes's total offense level arrived at by the court was 43 with a criminal history category of I.
[3]  Reyes actually argues that the district court found that he committed the murder, but the record establishes that it found only that he was present. See J.A. 245, 254.
[4]  Reyes's arguments to the contrary are unavailing under review for clear error. He contends that the vague meanings of certain words during his conversation with the CS are insufficient to support the district court's finding; for example, Reyes used the word ""it"" in stating ""[t]he[] [lookouts] want[ed] to, but it was too sloppy. I just did it myself. I just felt it was personal. So I just did it."" J.A. 201 (emphasis added). Given that Reyes admitted that he and others disposed of Thompson's body and that he and others paid an individual to kill Thompson, his contention that ""it"" meant disposing of Thompson's body or paying for Thompson's murder is unpersuasive—he told the CS ""I just did it myself"" because ""it was personal."" J.A. 201 (emphasis added). Furthermore, we cannot conclude, as Reyes argues, that the cell-site evidence plainly contradicts the district court's finding that he was present when Thompson was killed. The cell-site evidence, which places Reyes in Brooklyn at the time of Thompson's murder, does not demonstrate that Reyes was 1.5 miles away from Thompson at the time of the murder, as he contends; rather, it shows that Reyes's cell phone pinged off a tower that was 1.5 miles away when Thompson made her final telephone call.
[5]  The Government does not argue on appeal that its failure to formally move for a one-level reduction under subsection (b) obviates the need to reach the district court's error in denying the reduction for discretionary reasons. Therefore, this argument is forfeited.
[6]  We note that the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, at the time of Reyes's sentencing, would have resulted in a total offense level of 42 and a Guidelines range of 360 months' to life imprisonment, a lesser range than the district court considered. The sentencing transcript provides us no basis from which to conclude this procedural error was harmless—that is, the district court clearly would have imposed a life sentence absent the error. See United States v. Cramer, 777 F.3d 597, 601 (2d Cir. 2015) (""[W]here we identify procedural error in a sentence, but the record indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event, the error may be deemed harmless, avoiding the need to vacate the sentence and to remand the case for resentencing."" (alterations omitted)).

SUSAN C. WOLFE, New York, New York, for Defendant-Appellant.
Before: KEARSE, CABRANES, and WESLEY, Circuit Judges.
KEARSE, Circuit Judge.
Defendant Jason Smathers, who was convicted in 2005, following his plea of guilty, of conspiring, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, to misappropriate and sell property of America Online (""AOL""), and was ordered to, inter alia, pay AOL restitution in the amount of $84,000, appeals from a June 22, 2016 order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Alvin K. Hellerstein, Judge, denying his motion, made pro se, for a reduction of his remaining restitution obligation by amounts recovered by AOL in civil litigation against other persons. The district court ruled that Smathers failed to show that those amounts recovered by AOL were compensation for the same loss caused by Smathers or that AOL has been fully compensated for the loss caused by Smathers. On appeal, Smathers, represented by counsel, contends principally that the district court erred in imposing on him ""the full burden"" (Smathers brief on appeal at 26) of proving that AOL's recoveries were for the same loss caused by Smathers and that the court clearly erred in finding that the losses were not the same. He also complains that the district court denied his motion without a hearing. Concluding that his contentions lack merit, we affirm.
I. BACKGROUND
The record of Smathers's prosecution, United States v. Smathers, S.D.N.Y. No. 04CR1273, shows the following. In 2005, Smathers, represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to conspiring from about April 2003 through about April 2004, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, to affect interstate commerce by relaying and retransmitting deceptive emails in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1037, and to transmit in interstate commerce a stolen list of AOL customer names, having a value of $5,000 or more, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Smathers, an employee of AOL, misappropriated an AOL customer list containing approximately 92 million screen names. Smathers sold that list (""the Smathers List"") to Sean Dunaway for $28,000; Dunaway sold that list to Braden Bournival; Bournival used it to send to AOL customers between three and seven billion unsolicited email advertisements (or ""spam,"" see The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language at 1678 (5th ed. 2011) (defining ""spam"" as, inter alia, ""[u]nsolicited email, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups"")). AOL estimated that the cost of processing those spam emails was about 10 cents per 1,000 emails, amounting to $300,000-$700,000.
Smathers was sentenced principally to 15 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay restitution to AOL. In determining the amount of Smathers's restitution obligation under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (""MVRA""), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A and 3664, the district court noted that Smathers's plea agreement stated that the loss to AOL was $300,000; but the court declined to order Smathers to pay restitution in that amount because, inter alia, some portion was overhead rather than out-of-pocket expense, and it thought that ordering him to pay $300,000 would give AOL a windfall. Instead, trebling the $28,000 that Smathers had received for selling the AOL list, the court ordered Smathers to pay restitution in the amount of $84,000. The judgment so ordered but stated that the ""Total Loss"" was ""$300,000."" Judgment, August 17, 2005.
A. Smathers's First Attempt To Reduce His Restitution Obligation
In March 2007, Smathers's attorney sent a letter to the district court stating, inter alia, that AOL had commenced a civil suit, America Online, Inc. v. Hawke, 04-259-A (E.D. Va.) (""Hawke Litigation""), against Davis Wolfgang Hawke, Bournival (who had purchased the Smathers List from Dunaway), and others. (See Letter from Susan C. Wolfe to Honorable Alvin K. Hellerstein dated March 26, 2007 (""2007 Wolfe Letter""), at 3.) The letter stated that the Hawke Litigation docket indicated that AOL had reached an undisclosed settlement with Bournival and had obtained a $12,834,553.82 default judgment against Hawke and two others; and that ""various internet news sources"" stated that AOL had collected some $95,000 and a Hummer vehicle in that litigation. (Id.) Smathers contended that the $95,000 alone exceeded his entire restitution obligation (see 2007 Wolfe Letter at 3) and asked the court to determine the full amount of AOL's recoveries and to determine whether or to what extent his restitution obligation should be modified pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3664(j)(2).
In response, the court gave Smathers ""permission to file a motion for appropriate relief based on affidavits and competent proof."" Order dated March 26, 2007 (""2007 Order""). No such motion was forthcoming.
B. Smathers's Subsequent Requests for Reduction
Eight years later, Smathers sent a pro se letter to the district court ""request[ing] a status conference regarding the restitution ordered in []his case."" (Letter from Jason Smathers to Honorable Alvin K. Hellerstein dated March 2, 2015 (""Smathers 2015 Letter""), at 1.) He stated that restitution payments had been made by Dunaway in Dunaway's criminal case and that payments had been made by Bournival in AOL's civil litigation—referred to in the 2007 Wolfe Letter. He stated that those payments were for the same loss that he had caused (see Smathers 2015 Letter at 1 n.1) and that he believed that ""the restitution ordered in []his case"" had therefore been ""collected in full already through third party payments"" (id. at 1).
The district court responded that a status conference was not appropriate because there were no ongoing proceedings before the court. It stated that any request for relief should be made by motion, showing the court's jurisdiction and the reasons supporting the relief requested.
Nearly a year later, Smathers brought his present pro se Motion To Compel Proper Enforcement of Restitution Order and Injunction, filed February 24, 2016 (""2016 Restitution Reduction Motion""), repeating his contention that the restitution payments made by Dunaway and the payment by Bournival in settlement of AOL's civil suit were for the same loss caused by Smathers and were sufficient in amount to extinguish Smathers's restitution obligation. No details were cited, and no affidavits or other evidentiary materials were submitted. Instead, Smathers argued that the government ""should . . . have access"" to the sealed documents in the AOL civil litigation, ""should be in the position to determine all payments made for the same action and reduce the restitution amount by these third party payments,"" and should be ordered to ""reduce [Smathers's] restitution amount"" by the amounts paid by Dunaway and Bournival. (Id. at 2; see id. at 3.)
The district court ordered the government to respond to the motion and to ""make timely appl[icatio]n . . . to unseal any relevant case files or orders."" Order dated February 29, 2016.
The government did not seek the unsealing of any documents in AOL's civil litigation. Rather, it responded to Smathers's 2016 contention that the payments to AOL by Dunaway and Bournival reduced or eliminated Smathers's restitution obligation by noting, in part, that
Smathers made the same argument in a March 26, 2007 letter to the Court. At that time, the Court ordered the defendant ""to file a motion for appropriate relief, based on Affidavits and competent proof . . . ."" (Dkt. No. 40). Smathers never did so. Rather, Smathers's most recent application simply posits he is entitled to relief unless the Government proves otherwise. He is not.
Unless and until Smathers comes forward with proof, the Court should deny Smathers's motion.
(Letter from Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Thomas to Honorable Alvin K. Hellerstein dated April 11, 2016, at 1 (emphases ours).)
The government argued, inter alia, that while Smathers ""declare[d]"" that the moneys received by AOL were for the same loss that Smathers caused, he had not presented any evidence to support either that proposition (id. at 2) or the proposition that the amounts received by AOL totaled the $300,000 listed in the Judgment against Smathers as AOL's total loss (see id. at 1).
Smathers filed a reply memorandum arguing, inter alia, that $300,000 should not be considered the amount of AOL's loss, that the district court ""determined this amount was not sufficiently proven and instead used $84,000,"" and that AOL ""should be considered fully recovered when"" it has recovered ""$84,000 from any source."" (Smathers's Reply to Government's Opposition to Defendant's Motion To Compel Proper Enforcement of Restitution Order and Injunction at 1.) He reiterated assertions made in the 2007 Wolfe Letter that news reports said AOL had collected more than $84,000, plus a Hummer. (See id. at 4.)
Smathers argued that the government is ""in a position to verify the facts alleged in [his] motion"" and should do so instead of continuing to ""pursue collection of restitution without taking any steps to verify if any or all of the restitution has been recovered."" (Id. at 2.) And Smathers argued that if $300,000 is the correct loss number, the government should be required to ""provide an accounting of the victim's recovery from all sources to see if this amount has been paid."" (Id. at 3.) He also asked the court to appoint counsel for him and provide instruction as to how to proceed. (See id. at 5.)
C. The District Court's Decision
In an order dated June 22, 2016 (""June 2016 Order""), the district court denied Smathers's motion. While noting that at Smathers's sentencing it had expressed ""discomfort with [$300,000] as the loss amount,"" id. at 2, the court in ruling on Smathers's motion for restitution credit pointed out, inter alia, that ""AOL [had] placed a value of $300,000 on the lists of customers that defendant and others stole,"" id., and that Smathers had ""signed a plea agreement by which he had agreed that the intended loss to . . . []AOL[] was $300,000,"" id. at 1. In addition, the court stated that a customer list is
[a]n asset of [a] sort [that] cannot readily be measured, for the theft of personal information has significant consequences beyond the names on the list. The value of the loss to AOL is much beyond the profits gained by the criminals who stole the names and sold them into the black market for assets of this type. In sentencing Smathers, I considered values relevant to sentencing, including that it would be impossible for defendant to pay. See U.S.S.G. 5E1.1. I defined the loss he intended as approximately equivalent to the profit Smathers gained, trebled—$84,000. I considered it fair not to place values on intangibles for purposes of mandatory restitution, even if those values might be considered reasonable in the commercial market.
June 2016 Order at 2 (emphases added).
Rejecting the request that Smathers be given credit for restitution payments made by Dunaway, the court noted that Dunaway and Smathers had paid AOL only $6,219.92 and $5,894, respectively, towards their restitution obligations, see id. at 2, and thus, ""jointly and severally, ha[d] not come anywhere close to compensating AOL for its loss caused by their criminal scheme,"" id. at 3. And after noting the contentions as to AOL's settlements and default judgments in civil litigation, see id. at 2-3, the court rejected Smathers's claim for restitution credit on that basis, finding that
the recoveries by AOL in those cases were not necessarily, and do not appear to be for the same loss caused by Dunaway and Smathers—nothing in the complaints in those cases suggests a connection between Dunaway and Smathers and the other individuals. . . . The fact that AOL has recovered from other spammers does not reduce Smathers' obligation, and his motion is denied.
The clerk shall mark the motion (Doc. No. 44) terminated.
Id. at 3 (emphasis added).
II. DISCUSSION
On appeal, Smathers, represented by counsel once again, contends principally that the district court (a) erred in imposing on him ""the full burden of pro[ving]"" that AOL's civil litigation recoveries were for the same loss that he caused (Smathers brief on appeal at 26), and (b) clearly erred in finding that the losses were not the same. For the reasons that follow, we find no basis for reversal.
The general goal of the MVRA, which is codified largely at 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A and 3664, is to provide full compensation to victims of certain types of crimes. It provides, inter alia, that a defendant who is convicted of specified categories of felonies, including crimes against property in which an identifiable victim has suffered a pecuniary loss, shall, in addition to receiving any other penalty, be ordered to make restitution to the victim of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A(a)(1), 3663A(c)(1). However, the MVRA is interpreted as not authorizing a victim's recovery of more than the amount of its loss. See, e.g., United States v. Nucci, 364 F.3d 419, 423-24 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. Elson, 577 F.3d 713, 734-35 (6th Cir. 2009) (""Elson""); United States v. Stanley, 309 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir. 2002); United States v. Dawson, 250 F.3d 1048, 1050-51 (7th Cir. 2001).
The conclusion that the MVRA does not authorize a victim to recover more than its total loss is based in part on § 3664(j), which states that
[a]ny amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in—
(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and
(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by the law of the State,
18 U.S.C. § 3664(j)(2) (emphasis added). It is on this provision that Smathers principally relies.
""In general, we review an MVRA order of restitution deferentially, and we will reverse only for abuse of discretion."" United States v. Boccagna, 450 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). An abuse of discretion exists if the ""challenged ruling rests on an error of law, a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or otherwise cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). ""Where there are challenges to the court's findings of fact, we review for clear error; insofar as the order rests on interpretations of law, we review those interpretations de novo."" United States v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).
A. Appealability of the Denial of a Motion for Reduction
Beforereaching the merits of Smathers's MVRA contentions, however, we consider the matter of appellate jurisdiction. With exceptions not pertinent here, federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction to entertain appeals only from ""final decisions."" 28 U.S.C. § 1291; see generally Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). An order in a postjudgment proceeding is not necessarily a final decision ""simply because it follows the entry of judgment."" United States v. Yalincak, 853 F.3d 629, 636 (2d Cir. 2017) (""Yalincak""). ""Generally, a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
In Yalincak, we analyzed the finality of a district court order that, in 2007, had— erroneously, see id. at 635—granted the defendant's postjudgment motions under § 3664(j)(2) to reduce his remaining restitution obligation by crediting him with certain funds recovered by a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings. Whether that 2007 grant of restitution credit was a ""final"" decision became an issue when the district court vacated it in 2015, invoking the court's inherent ""power to grant relief from erroneous interlocutory orders,"" 853 F.3d at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted); the defendant appealed from the 2015 order, contending that the prior order was a final decision that the district court had no power to alter. We agreed that the court lacked the authority to vacate its 2007 order because ""an order granting a motion for credit under 18 U.S.C. § 3664(j)(2) is final and thus appealable"" when it ""conclusively determines a defendant's entitlement to credit under § 3664(j)(2) for particular funds,"" 853 F.3d at 632-33; and the court had ""conclusively,"" and ""unconditionally grant[ed] Yalincak's motions for credit,"" id. at 633, 640.
In the present case, the district court's June 2016 Order was a final decision on Smathers's 2016 Restitution Reduction Motion. The court's dismissal of Smathers's claim for credit, as presented in 2016, was based on Smathers's failure to present proof either that AOL's civil litigation recoveries were for the same loss caused by Smathers or that AOL had recovered sums compensating it for the total amount of loss caused by Smathers. This decision stands in clear contrast to the court's reaction to Smathers's 2007 quest for restitution credit for those AOL recoveries, as set out in the 2007 Wolfe Letter. In 2007, the district court did not decide whether or not Smathers was entitled to credit; rather, it gave him leave to pursue such credit by presenting competent supporting evidence. The June 2016 Order—entered after Smathers formally requested restitution credit (again without evidentiary support) and replied to the government's opposition—denied Smathers's motion because of lack of proof, and ""terminated"" the motion. June 2016 Order at 3. That unconditional dismissal of Smathers's claim for credit as unsubstantiated was a final decision, appealable pursuant to § 1291.
B. Allocations of the Burden of Proof Under the MVRA
Smathers contends principally that the district court erred in placing on him the burden of proving that AOL's recoveries in civil litigation were ""for the same loss"" he caused, 18 U.S.C. § 3664(j)(2), and that those recoveries equaled or exceeded the loss he caused. We disagree.
The MVRA states that ""[a]ny dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence,"" 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e), and provides for various allocations of the burden of proof:
The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the Government. The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant's dependents, shall be on the defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as the court deems appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the court as justice requires.
Id. (emphasis added). Thus, as to issues other than the amount of the victim's loss and the finances of the defendant and his dependents, the MVRA entrusts allocation of the burden of proof to the district court's discretion.
As a general matter, the burden of proof as to a given issue is normally placed on the party that has an affirmative goal and presumptive access to proof. See, e.g., United States v. Technodyne LLC, 753 F.3d 368, 380 (2d Cir. 2014); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486 (Chadbourne rev. 1981). With respect to requests by defendants for credits against their restitution obligations, this principle has been applied to place the burden of proof on the defendant, whether the payments to the victim were made by the defendant himself, see, e.g., United States v. Sheinbaum, 136 F.3d 443, 449 (5th Cir. 1998) (""the burden of proving an offset should lie with the defendant"" because ""the defendant should know the value of any compensation he has already provided to the victim""), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1133 (1999); United States v. Malone, 747 F.3d 481, 486 (7th Cir. 2014) (""the defendant is in the best position to know what he has returned to the victim and has the strongest incentive to litigate the issue""), or were made by other persons, see Elson, 577 F.3d at 734.
In Elson, the defendant—in a direct appeal from the restitution portion of his sentence for conspiracy to obstruct a grand jury investigation by concealing assets from creditors, his ex-wife, and the government—challenged the denial of restitution credit for a civil lawsuit settlement payment to a victim by one of Elson's coconspirators, and for the transfer of property to the government by another coconspirator. The court of appeals, noting that the MVRA allocates the burdens of proof as to various issues to ""the parties who are best able to satisfy those burdens,"" stated that ""[t]he burden of proving an offset should lie with the defendant."" 577 F,3d at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that Elson had not carried that burden.
As to the settlement payment received by one victim from a coconspirator, Elson was held not entitled to restitution credit for the entire loss because he ""ha[d] not shown that,"" the victim had actually ""received compensation"" for that entire loss. Id. at 734; see also id. at 735 (""funds the victims have not received cannot reduce or offset the amount of losses the defendant is required to repay"" (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Yalincak, 853 F.3d at 635 (credit inappropriate until the offsetting funds are actually received by the victim); United States v. McGinn, 787 F.3d 116, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2015) (same). As to the property that Elson's coconspirator turned over to the government, the court noted, inter alia, that Elson had not shown that that was the same property of which the victims had been defrauded, see Elson, 577 F.3d at 734-35, and that Elson ""ha[d] not met his burden of showing that the government . . . collected on the returned [property] and distributed the proceeds to the victims,"" id. at 735.
In the present case, Smathers unquestionably has the strongest incentive to establish that he is entitled to a reduction of his remaining restitution obligation. And as the government was not a party to the civil litigation on which Smathers relies, the government has no greater access than Smathers to the records in that litigation. We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination that justice required that Smathers—who caused injury to AOL and seeks credit for payments to AOL by other persons—have the burden of proving that recoveries by AOL in civil litigation were for the same loss that he caused and that AOL has been compensated in full for the loss he caused.
C. Other Contentions
Smathers also contends, inter alia, that the district court's refusal to find that the AOL recoveries were for the same loss caused by Smathers was clearly erroneous, and that the court improperly denied his motion without a hearing. His contentions are meritless.
Smathers's argument that AOL's Hawke Litigation complaint itself showed that any recovery in that case compensated the same loss that was caused by Smathers is far wide of the mark. In so arguing, he quotes an allegation in that complaint that the defendants ""conspired [. . .] with one another and third parties to intentionally exceed authorized access to AOL's Protected Computer Facilities by harvesting and collecting AOL Member e-mail addresses."" (Smathers brief on appeal at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).) But the individual defendants in that case were Hawke, Bournival, and 50 John-Doe defendants whose names were not then known to AOL (see Hawke Litigation complaint ¶¶ 1, 12); and Smathers cannot point to anything in the complaint that mentions his name. Further, given the quoted allegation's reference to plural ""third parties,"" nothing implies that the defendants obtained stolen AOL customer lists only from Smathers.
Nor do we see any error in the district court's conclusion that Smathers's remaining restitution obligation should not be reduced by restitution payments made by Dunaway. The court found that the restitution payments made by Smathers and those made by Dunaway do not total as much as $84,000, a finding that is not challenged. And the Judgment against Smathers stated that AOL's total loss was $300,000—the amount of loss that Smathers's plea agreement stated was intended.
To the extent that Smathers contends he has been denied a fair hearing, his contention is meritless. As described in Part I above, despite being informed by the district court's 2007 Order that any motion for restitution credit should be accompanied by affidavits or other competent proof, Smathers has repeatedly argued only that the burden should be on the government to disprove assertions as to which he has presented no competent evidence. The court heard those arguments; no further hearing was required.
CONCLUSION
We have considered all of Smathers's contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The June 2016 Order of the district court is affirmed.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.
William Robinson and his co-plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York dismissing their claim that various United States law enforcement agencies jeopardize the constitutional rights of prospective American gun owners by mishandling their personal information in the course of conducting routine background checks. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
The appellants are a collection of individuals and organizations committed to Second Amendment advocacy. They allege that the Government violates First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment protections, along with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 705, when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (""ATF"") subjects potential firearm purchasers to background checks that cross-reference their personal information with the Terrorist Screening Database (""TSDB""), a master watchlist of individuals known or suspected of having terrorist ties. They frame the alleged screening practices as an unlawful expansion of The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the ""Brady Act""), Pub. L. No. 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536 (1993), which created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (""NICS Background Check"") to prevent the transfer of firearms to individuals barred from firearm possession by federal or state law. 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(t),(g),(n).
All persons attempting to purchase firearms must undergo an NICS Background Check. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(t), 923(a). As part of that procedure, prospective customers must complete a firearms transaction record known as the ATF Form 4473, which elicits personal information and propounds questions to certify that the customer is qualified to possess a firearm under the enumerated Brady Act factors. 27 C.F.R. § 478.124; 28 C.F.R. § 25.7(a); 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)-(9),(n) (setting forth ten conditions that render an individual ineligible to purchase a firearm). The Form 4473 information is then compared against databases from multiple agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center (""NCIC""). See 28 C.F.R. § 25.6(c)(1)(iii). Since 2004, the NCIC has incorporated data from the TSDB.[1] See J. App'x at 271-72. When the background check produces a ""match"" with any NCIC records, including those that may also reside in the TSDB, the application is delayed while NICS agents research the transaction to determine whether the individual would be prohibited by law from receiving or possessing a firearm. See 28 C.F.R. § 25.6(c)(1)(iv)(B). If the agent confirms that the customer fits one of the disqualifying conditions spelled out in 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g),(n), the application is denied; if no prohibiting information is discovered (or three business days go by without a response), the sale proceeds. Id. § 25.6(c)(1)(iv)(B)-(C).
Appellants allege that this so-called ""NICS-to-TSDB connection"" procedure exceeds the agency's statutory authority and ""amounts to domestic spying."" Appellant's Br. at 25. The individual appellants allege that the defendants' conduct caused them to suffer a particularized constitutional deprivation because they each provided information on Form 4473s in the course of routine firearm purchases and would like to continue making such purchases in the future. The appellants do not allege, however, that they were denied firearms or they suffered delay in purchase; they do not claim to be listed in the TSDB; nor do they contend that any of their information has been compiled or retained beyond the screening period in violation of law. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(t)(2)(C); 28 CFR § 25.9(b)(1). The district court therefore concluded that ""Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that they have been, or will be, personally injured by the challenged conduct"" and dismissed the complaint for lack of standing. Robinson v. Sessions, 260 F. Supp. 3d 264, 274 (W.D.N.Y. 2017). ""The existence of standing is a question of law that we review de novo."" Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 214 (2d Cir. 2004). To have standing, a party must allege ""such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure that the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution."" Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The ""irreducible constitutional minimum of standing"" requires that ""the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical."" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The ""injury in fact"" standing requirement ""applies with special force"" where, as here, ""a plaintiff files suit to require an executive agency to `follow the law'; at that point, the citizen must prove that he `has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of that [challenged] action and it is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.'"" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1552 (2016) (quoting Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633, 634 (1937) (per curiam)); see also Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 490, 496-97 (2009) (requiring a ""concrete interest"" affected by the challenged conduct for standing to vindicate a procedural right).
The appellants fail to identify a direct injury in fact that they have sustained or will sustain as a result of the alleged Government conduct. They discuss at length why (in their view) the inclusion of TSDB data in the NICS Background Check is unauthorized, wrong, and even unconstitutional. But we do not ""entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws."" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 581 (Kennedy, J. concurring); accord Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1549 (""Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.""). The appellants do not explain how they themselves have been subjected to any harm by the challenged conduct, such as the deprivation of a Second Amendment right to bear arms or a Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches or breach of privacy.[2] See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 411 (2013)(holding that plaintiffs unable to allege that their communications were actually monitored under challenged statute lacked standing); see also Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Nat'l Sec. Agency, 493 F.3d 644, 665-66, 673 (6th Cir. 2007)(opinion of Batchelder, J.).[3] There is no evidence that any of these appellants were unable to purchase a firearm, were delayed in purchasing a firearm, or were listed on the TSDB such that their information was allegedly compromised.[4] At most, the complaint articulates ""a highly attenuated chain of possibilities"" that could, in combination with a number of unpled facts, perpetrate the alleged constitutional harm. Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013); see also Summers, 555 U.S. at 495-96. The standing of the appellants cannot be inferred from the speculative theory that were they to appear on the TSDB, their Form 4473 information might cross-reference to a file on the NCIC, which could result in a delay or denial in their transaction. See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 413-14 (declining to endorse a standing theory requiring a chain of speculation).
The appellants also argue that they are harmed by the perceived stigma of the association of gun owners with terrorists. They posit that the inclusion of a TSDB file in one of the databases cross-referenced by the NICS Background Check amounts to labeling all gun owners as terrorists, and thereby creates a direct reputational injury. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 754-55 (1984) (stating that injury premised on stigma ""accords a basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct""), abrogated in part on other grounds by Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377 (2014).
As the Government points out, this argument is facially incoherent as it suggests that the (unchallenged) criminal background checks done under the Brady Act brand all gun owners as felons or sexual miscreants. More importantly, a valid theory of stigmatizing injury rests on discriminatory conduct within a defined class of persons, not an ""abstract stigmatic injury"" affecting all gun owners. In re U.S. Catholic Conference (USCC), 885 F.2d 1020, 1025 (2d Cir. 1989) (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 755-56). Like the plaintiff clergy in In re U.S. Catholic Conference, the appellants' ""self-perceived `stigma' does not amount to a particularized injury in fact"" because they ""have neither been personally denied equal treatment under the law nor in any way prosecuted by"" any government agency. Id. at 1026. For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Robinson's other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  The Brady Act provides that ""the Attorney General may secure directly from any department or agency of the United States such information on persons for whom receipt of a firearm would violate [18 U.S.C. §§ 922(t),(n)] or State law."" Pub. L. No. 103-159, § 103(e)(1).
[2]  For the same reason, we reject the appellants' assertion that they will suffer a cognizable injury in fact because NICS forces them to ""choose"" between their Second and First or Fourth Amendment rights. This is, in effect, an argument that the appellants are at risk of suffering the same constitutional harms alleged here in the future. Since the appellants fail to demonstrate that they have been or will imminently be subject to the challenged conduct, their unsubstantiated fears of a speculative harm or a `chill' on Second Amendment activity are insufficient to confer standing. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972) (""Allegations of a subjective `chill' are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm."").
[3]  Appellants argue that they have been suffering injury because the Government has exceeded its statutory authority and incorporated the TSDB into the NICS Background Check. In appellants' view, comparing their Form 4473 information against a database incorporating the TSDB—standing alone—is a cognizable injury. Appellants' theory of harm, however, is incongruous. The Brady Act provides the Government with the authority to access any search criteria that will enable it to determine whether a prospective purchaser is prohibited by the Gun Control Act from purchasing a firearm. See Brady Act, Pub. L. No. 103-159, § 103(e)(1), 107 Stat. 1536, 1542 (1993). Incorporating the TSDB into the NICS Background Check protocol is merely one method that the Government may use to determine whether a prospective purchaser possesses a disqualifying attribute. Appellants therefore fail to identify how the Government's search procedure causes them injury. See Bauer v. Veneman, 352 F.3d 625, 636-37 (2d Cir. 2003) (""While the standard for reviewing standing at the pleading stage is lenient, a plaintiff cannot rely solely on conclusory allegations of injury or ask the court to draw unwarranted inferences in order to find standing."").
[4]  The individual appellants are joined by several non-profit corporations and unincorporated associations. Since the organizational appellants' standing can only be sustained as an extension of the standing of individual members, their claims must also fail. See Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 733-34.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Xie Zhang-Zhou, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a March 8, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming an October 27, 2014, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Zhang-Zhou's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Xie Zhang-Zhou, No. A205 338 164 (B.I.A. Mar. 8, 2016), aff'g No. A205 338 164 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 27, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ's and the BIA's decisions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable standards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir. 2009).
The governing REAL ID Act credibility standard provides that the agency must ""[c]onsider[] the totality of the circumstances,"" and may base a credibility finding on an applicant's ""demeanor, candor, or responsiveness,"" the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his or his witness's statements, ""without regard to whether"" they go ""to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam). ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless . . . it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. Further, ""[a] petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency's finding that Zhang-Zhou was not credible.
First, the agency reasonably relied on the inconsistencies in and omissions from Zhang-Zhou's credible fear interview about whether he was arrested, detained, or harmed in China due to his Yiguan Dao religion. See Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3 (""An inconsistency and an omission are, for [credibility] purposes, functionally equivalent.""); Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 724-25 (2d Cir. 2009) (observing that the agency may base an adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies arising from a credible fear interview). Zhang-Zhou's statements during his credible fear interview directly contradicted the representations in his application and testimony that he was arrested for practicing Yiguan Dao. At the interview, he stated he was never harmed in China on account of his religion and had never been arrested or detained. The agency reasonably rejected as implausible Zhang-Zhou's explanation that he did not remember his arrest and detention, when that is why he claims to have fled China in the first place. See Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80; Zhang, 585 F.3d at 725 (""We again reject the notion that a petitioner's claim that she was nervous and distracted during the credible fear interview automatically undermines or negates its reliability as a source of her statements."").
Second, the agency reasonably relied on the omission of Zhang-Zhou's arrest, detention, and religious practice from his wife's letter. See Lin, 534 F.3d at 167 (affirming adverse credibility determination based, in part, on omissions from corroborating letters). Zhang-Zhou testified that his wife was aware of his practice of Yiguan Dao and had paid to secure his release from detention; however, his wife reported only that she was harassed by the village head and government officials every few days, but did not reference Zhang-Zhou's practice or arrest. Zhang-Zhou initially explained that his wife did not mention his practice of Yiguan Dao because she was already aware of it. The IJ was not compelled to accept Zhang-Zhou's explanations for the omission because Zhang-Zhou conceded that the letter was prepared for court and because his responses did not otherwise relate to the omission. See Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80.
Third, the agency's adverse credibility determination is bolstered by the IJ's observations of Zhang-Zhou's demeanor. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). ""We give particular deference to credibility determinations that are based on the adjudicator's observation of the applicant's demeanor,"" Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir. 2005), particularly where, as here, the demeanor finding is directly linked to an inconsistency in the record, Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 2006) (""We can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant's demeanor where, as here, they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony."").
Last, the agency reasonably found Zhang-Zhou's corroborating evidence insufficient to rehabilitate his credibility. See Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (""An applicant's failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.""). Although the parties stipulated that Zhang-Zhou's witness would have testified that Zhang-Zhou attended a Yiguan Dao temple in the United States, the IJ reasonably found this testimony insufficient to rehabilitate Zhang-Zhou's claim because it did not relate to his allegations of past harm and there was no documentary evidence linking Zhang-Zhou or his witness to the temple. See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir. 2006) (observing that the weight accorded to an applicant's evidence ""lie[s] largely within the discretion of the IJ"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Given the demeanor, inconsistency, and omission findings, all of which related to the main basis of Zhang-Zhou's claim—his Yiguan Dao practice and arrest—we conclude that the totality of the circumstances supports the adverse credibility determination. See Lin, 534 F.3d at 165-66; Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 295 (2d Cir. 2006) (""Because the [agency] has identified a material inconsistency in an aspect of [petitioner]'s story that served as an example of the very persecution from which he sought asylum, we hold that the inconsistency afforded substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility finding."" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). A reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude otherwise. Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. The credibility finding is dispositive of Zhang-Zhou's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all of these claims are based on the same discredited factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.
Petitioner Ah Moy Mok, a native and citizen of Malaysia, seeks review of a March 23, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a December 18, 2014, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Mok's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Ah Moy Mok, No. A201 110 851 (B.I.A. Mar. 23, 2016), aff'g No. A201 110 851 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 18, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
""[W]e review the judgment of the IJ as modified by the BIA's decision—that is, minus [any] argument[s] for denying relief that w[ere] rejected by the BIA."" Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we reach only the agency's denial of Mok's asylum claim as time barred and its conclusion that she failed to establish that she was a member of a legally cognizable particular social group. Id. Mok has waived any challenge to the denial of CAT relief by not sufficiently arguing that claim in her brief. Norton v. Sam's Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998) (""Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal."").
We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction to the extent Mok challenges the agency's denial of asylum. Our jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum as untimely or the agency's findings regarding changed or extraordinary circumstances is limited to ""constitutional claims or questions of law."" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3). Mok argues that more weight should have been given to the obstacle posed by her illiteracy. Because Mok's challenge is to the weight of the evidence, she is challenging a discretionary determination and does not raise a constitutional claim or question of law reviewable by this Court. See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that ""we remain deprived of jurisdiction to review decisions under the INA when the petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of an IJ's fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion and raises neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law."").
We deny the petition as to Mok's challenge to the denial of withholding of removal. To be eligible for withholding of removal, Mok was required to ""establish[] that it is more likely than not that [her] life or freedom would be threatened"" in Malaysia because of her ""race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), 1231(b)(3)(A). To be legally cognizable, a particular social group must be ""composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question."" Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d 191, 196 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Matter of M----E----V----G----, 26 I. & N. Dec. 227, 237 (B.I.A. 2014)). We review factual findings under the substantial evidence standard and questions of law—including the question of whether a group constitutes a particular social group—de novo. Id. at 195.
Mok attacks the agency's determination that she failed to establish that she was a member of a legally cognizable particular social group. But the agency reasonably determined that Mok's proposed particular social group—""elderly, sick ethnic Chinese women from Malaysia"" or ""sick elderly ethnic Chinese women without employment to access needed health care in Malaysia""—was not socially distinct. Id. at 196 (""[W]hat matters is whether society as a whole [perceives] a group as socially distinct.""). Mok testified that healthcare was available to ethnic Chinese women in Malaysia, but contended that she would be unable to afford it because, as an older woman, she would be unemployable. But the evidence submitted by Mok shows that the affordability of healthcare and unemployment are widespread issues in Malaysia, not that older women are treated or viewed with distinction in this area.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.

GARY SOULES, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF CONNECTICUT, DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PUBLIC PROTECTION, STATE OF CONNECTICUT, AND TOWN OF OXFORD, Defendants-Appellees.
No. 17-52-cv.
United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.
Argued: December 1, 2017.
Decided: February 8, 2018.
Gary Soules appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Bryant, J.) dismissing his complaint sua sponte on the ground of res judicata. Soules' first action alleged harassment, discrimination, and retaliation by defendants on the basis of his disabilities, military status, and certain protected activities. After dismissal, Soules brought this second action alleging a nearly identical set of facts and claims, adding a single further allegation: that defendants terminated his employment in retaliation for filing the first action.
We conclude that Soules effectively amended his complaint via the motion papers in the first action to add a retaliatory termination claim. Accordingly, Soules could have raised his termination claim in the first action and did, and thus res judicata precludes Soules from litigating the claim in this subsequent case. We also reject Soules' argument that the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies prevented him from raising the termination claim in the first action; the claim was ""reasonably related"" to the original administrative charge, and therefore Soules would not have been barred from bringing the claim in the first action. Furthermore, res judicata applies to claims pending review in administrative proceedings. The requirement to exhaust administrative remedies therefore does not alter our conclusion that res judicata precludes the second action. Affirmed.

Before: JACOBS, RAGGI, and DRONEY, Circuit Judges.
DENNIS JACOBS, Circuit Judge.
Gary Soules appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Bryant, J.) dismissing his complaint sua sponte on the ground of res judicata. Soules' first lawsuit was dismissed. See Soules v. Connecticut, No. 3:14-CV-1045 (VLB), 2015 WL 5797014 (D. Conn. Sept. 30, 2015) (""Soules I""). The dismissal was affirmed in part and vacated in part (on grounds not relevant to this appeal) by summary order. See Soules v. Town of Oxford, 669 F. App'x 54 (2d Cir. 2016). Soules brought the present case after the dismissal of the first case, alleging nearly identical claims with a single additional one: that defendants terminated his employment in retaliation for filing Soules I (the ""termination claim"").
On appeal, Soules argues that res judicata does not bar his termination claim because the termination happened after he filed the complaint in Soules I. However, Soules was fired while the motions to dismiss were pending and he repeatedly raised the termination issue as evidence that his claims were sufficiently pleaded. These filings indicate that Soules implicitly sought to amend his pleadings, and that the district court in effect permitted him to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that the termination claim could have been raised in the prior action and was, and that res judicata precludes Soules from asserting the claim in this subsequent action.
Soules also argues that he could not have asserted claims based on his termination because he was required to exhaust administrative remedies. However, the termination claim was ""reasonably related"" to the original administrative charge; so the exhaustion requirement would not have foreclosed raising the claim added in Soules I. In any event, the res judicata doctrine applies in administrative proceedings. The requirement to exhaust administrative remedies thus does not disturb our holding that the termination claim is barred by res judicata.
BACKGROUND
Soules, who is assumed to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, alleges that, while he was a police officer in the Town of Oxford, he was ""subjected to an ongoing pattern of harassment, discrimination, retaliation and disparate treatment based upon his [mental and physical] disabilities or perceived disabilities, his military service and in retaliation for his protected complaints."" Joint App'x 40, 42 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 17). Soules' supervisor, Sergeant Daniel Semosky, allegedly swore at Soules and said he was ""unhappy"" with Soules' return to work after a combat tour; and employees of the Town of Oxford and State Police allegedly physically intimidated him. Id. at 43-44 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23-25). Soules protested in writing to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (""DESPP""), and made that grievance known to other officers.
The complaint alleges that First Selectman George Temple instructed Soules to cut back enforcement of drunk driving laws, that Soules refused, and that disciplinary action ensued. Defendants allegedly solicited false complaints about Soules, created false performance evaluations, and attempted to have him arrested without probable cause.
On or about April 28, 2013, Soules filed a discrimination charge with the Connecticut Human Rights Office (""CHRO"") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""). Soules' first lawsuit, filed on July 23, 2014, alleged that defendants violated his rights under state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Soules I, 2015 WL 5797014, at *1-4. While the motions to dismiss in Soules I were pending, Soules was terminated on January 6, 2015, prompting him to file a separate charge with the CHRO. On September 30, 2015, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss.
On May 9, 2016, Soules filed a second action in the District of Connecticut against the same parties (minus two individual defendants) alleging a nearly identical set of facts and claims, but adding the allegation that defendants terminated Soules in retaliation for filing Soules I. Soules v. Connecticut, No. 3:16-cv-00703 (VLB), 2016 WL 7155731 (D. Conn. Dec. 7, 2016) (""Soules II""). The district court's dismissal of Soules II on the ground of res judicata prompted this appeal.
DISCUSSION
I
We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint on the ground of res judicata. EDP Medical Computer Sys., Inc. v. United States, 480 F.3d 621, 624 (2d Cir. 2007).
Res judicata bars re-litigation if ""(1) the previous action involved an adjudication on the merits; (2) the previous action involved the plaintiffs or those in privity with them; (3) the claims asserted in the subsequent action were, or could have been, raised in the prior action."" Monahan v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Corr., 214 F.3d 275, 285 (2d Cir. 2000). It is conceded that Soules I constituted an adjudication on the merits and that the first and second lawsuit involve the same parties. Accordingly, the only issue on appeal is whether Soules' termination claim in Soules II was raised, or could have been raised, in Soules I.
As to the third element, we consider whether the second lawsuit concerns ""the same claim—or nucleus of operative facts—as the first suit,"" applying three considerations: ""(1) whether the underlying facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation; (2) whether the underlying facts form a convenient trial unit; and (3) whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations."" Channer v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 527 F.3d 275, 280 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Res judicata ""is based on the requirement that the plaintiff must bring all claims at once against the same defendant relating to the same transaction or event."" N. Assur. Co. of Am. v. Square D Co., 201 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).
Soules contends that he merely mentioned his termination in Soules I; but the first lawsuit repeatedly pressed the termination issue. Examples abound. Thus: ""[a]fter the filing [of the complaint], the defendants further retaliated against the plaintiff by subjecting him to leave without pay, and further baseless demands that he submit to invasive examinations, with the intent to punish him and fabricate a grounds for his termination."" See Joint App'x 27 (Soules I Am. Compl. ¶ 61) (emphasis added). In a document that Soules entitled ""Objection to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss,"" which was attached to his memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to dismiss, Soules stated: ""[i]n addition to the unlawful conduct of the defendants directed at the plaintiff as set forth in his Amended Complaint, the plaintiff has been terminated by the defendants."" Objection to Defs.' Mots. To Dismiss at 1, Soules v. Connecticut, No. 3:14-cv-1045, (D. Conn. Feb. 10, 2015), ECF No. 40. He added: ""[t]his act of employment capital punishment occurred on or about January 6, 2015, after the filing of the Amended Complaint, and constitutes further unlawful conduct by the defendants."" Id. Soules' opposition to defendants' motions to dismiss declared on the first page of the memorandum that he ""has been terminated by the defendants,"" and that the termination ""constitutes further unlawful conduct."" Town of Oxford Supplemental App'x 21 (Opp. Br. at 1). His termination is mentioned throughout the opposition papers as the culmination of the course of retaliatory, discriminatory, and harassing conduct. Soules alleged that ""due to his disability or being regarded as disabled, he has been targeted for harassment and termination . . ."" Id. at 46 (Opp. Br. at 26). In a similar vein, Soules emphasized his termination to bolster the plausibility of his substantive due process claim, his claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (""USERRA""), and his First Amendment retaliation claim. See id. at 52, 60, 62, 69, 71 (Opp. Br. at 32, 40, 42, 49, 51). These filings reflect that Soules was seeking to update his claims to add a termination claim in the district court, and he repeatedly raised his termination in his brief to this Court in the Soules I appeal. See id. 140, 152, 159-61 (Br. for Appellant at 20, 32, 39-41). The complaint was thus effectively amended.
Soules relies on Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., which explains that for the purposes of res judicata ""the scope of litigation is framed by the complaint at the time it is filed,"" and that the doctrine ""does not apply to new rights acquired during the action which might have been, but which were not, litigated."" 126 F.3d 365, 369-70 (2d Cir. 1997). In Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A., we specifically applied this principle to a retaliatory discharge claim. See 400 F.3d 139, 141 (2d Cir. 2005) (""When Legnani filed her 1995 [Title VII] action, she had not yet been discharged from Alitalia. She could not have brought the retaliatory discharge action at that time and, accordingly, she was free to bring her retaliatory discharge claim in this subsequent action.""). Moreover, in Proctor v. LeClaire, we applied that rule where, as here, the plaintiff raised a subsequently arising claim in motion papers during the pendency of the first action. See 715 F.3d 402, 406-12 (2d Cir. 2013). Soules thus argues that res judicata does not bar claims that arose from transactions that occurred after he filed Soules I.
We conclude, however, that Soules' argument fails because his post-complaint conduct in Soules I effectively amended his complaint to add a retaliatory termination claim. Ordinarily, parties may not amend the pleadings through motion papers. See Shah v. Helen Hayes Hosp., 252 F. App'x 364, 365 (2d Cir. 2007) (summary order); Mathie v. Goord, 267 F. App'x 13, 14 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order). But our only holding is that ""a party is not entitled to amend its complaint through statements made in motion papers,"" Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis added), and ""entitlement"" is not the claim or the issue in this case. One may seek what one is not entitled to demand, and may get what one cannot claim as of right. Here, it appears that the district court implicitly permitted Soules to amend the initial complaint to address his employment termination. Soules can hardly claim on behalf of defendants that the amendment caused them prejudice. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (holding that ""undue prejudice to the opposing party,"" among other reasons, is a ground to deny leave to amend). Much less can he show good reason why he should be afforded the opportunity to pursue the claim again.
Soules I and Soules II repeatedly link Soules' termination to the same course of unlawful conduct by defendants. The termination in Soules II is thus ""related in time, space, origin, or motivation"" to the discriminatory and retaliatory conduct alleged in Soules I. Channer, 527 F.3d at 280. And because Soules I and Soules II allege the same conduct by defendants, there can be no question that addressing all of the claims at once would form a ""convenient trial unit"" and would ""conform[] to the parties' expectations."" Id. Computer Associates is thus inapposite to the circumstances here: if res judicata did not apply, the duplication of proceedings that would ensue, with the attendant waste of resources and risk of inconsistent results, is precisely what the doctrine of claim preclusion prevents. We conclude that the district court correctly ruled that res judicata bars this subsequent action.
II
Soules further argues that the dismissal should be reversed because it was impossible for him to assert the termination claim in Soules I without exhausting administrative remedies. Ordinarily, a plaintiff seeking to bring a claim pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), Title VII, or the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act (""CFEPA"") must exhaust administrative remedies through the EEOC or CHRO. See Williams v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 458 F.3d 67, 69 (2d Cir. 2006) (Title VII); J.C. v. Reg'l Sch. Dist. 10, Bd. of Educ., 278 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2002) (ADA); Sullivan v. Bd. of Police Comm'rs of City of Waterbury, 196 Conn. 208, 215-16 (1985) (CFEPA).
In this circuit, however, ""claims that were not asserted before the EEOC may be pursued in a subsequent federal court action if they are `reasonably related' to those that were filed with the agency."" Shah v. N.Y. State Dep't of Civil Servs., 168 F.3d 610, 614 (2d Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). ""Subsequent conduct is reasonably related to conduct in an EEOC charge if: the claim would fall within the reasonably expected scope of an EEOC investigation of the charges of discrimination; it alleges retaliation for filing the EEOC charge; or [3] the plaintiff alleges further incidents of discrimination carried out in precisely the same manner alleged in the EEOC charge."" Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 381 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Soules' termination claim was ""reasonably related"" to the original administrative charge under both the second and third Alfano exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.
As to the second exception, Soules draws a distinction between a claim of retaliation for filing an EEOC or CHRO charge, which would be subsumed in the original administrative filing, and the filing of a federal lawsuit (Soules I), which he argues (for some reason) would not. But the reason underlying this exception applies with equal force to retaliation for filing a federal lawsuit as it does for filing an administrative charge: ""the close connection of the retaliatory act to both the initial discriminatory conduct and the filing of the [lawsuit] itself."" Butts v. City of N.Y. Hous. Pres. and Dev., 990 F.2d 1397, 1402 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Owens v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 934 F.2d 405, 410-11 (2d Cir. 1991)). Requiring plaintiffs to file a second lawsuit regarding an employer's retaliatory conduct would duplicate investigations and waste resources on a claim concerning conduct already at issue in the first lawsuit; furthermore, it could perversely incentivize employers to retaliate in order to ""impose further costs on plaintiffs and delay the filing of civil actions relating to the underlying acts of discrimination."" Id. Because the termination claim was reasonably related to the original administrative charge, Soules would not have been barred from bringing the claim in Soules I.
As to the third exception, Soules contends that the termination claim does not allege ""discrimination carried out in precisely the same manner alleged in the EEOC charge."" Alfano, 294 F.3d at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted). Considering that the filings in both Soules I and Soules II allege that defendants retaliated against Soules for filing a complaint, that the retaliation took the form of disciplinary action, and that defendants were building a case for retaliatory termination, the termination claim bore (at least) a reasonable relationship to the claims in Soules I.
Res judicata applies to claims pending review in administrative proceedings. See Woods v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 972 F.2d 36, 37-41 (2d Cir. 1992). Soules therefore had two options after the termination of his employment: (1) request a stay of Soules I after he filed the second CHRO charge, and then seek to join the termination claim, or (2) seek to amend the Soules I complaint. See id. at 41. As explained above, Soules took the second option: his conduct amended the Soules I complaint to include a retaliatory termination claim. The requirement that plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies does not alter this conclusion. Accordingly, Soules' termination claim could have been fully litigated in Soules I and was, and res judicata therefore prohibits Soules from re-ligating it here.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioners Angela Suyapa Lara-Guzman and her daughter, Linny Sohele Rodriguez-Lara, natives and citizens of Honduras, seek review of an April 12, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming an August 24, 2015, decision of Immigration Judge (""IJ"") Philip Verrillo denying asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Angela Suyapa Lara-Guzman, Linny Sohele Rodriguez-Lara, Nos. A206 629 812/813 (B.I.A. Apr. 12, 2016), aff'g Nos. A206 629 812/13 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Aug. 24, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable standards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also Chuilu Liu v. Holder, 575 F.3d 193, 196 (2d Cir. 2009). The agency did not err in concluding that Lara-Guzman failed to satisfy her burden of proof as to her claim that the father of her children abused her for years in Honduras and that police did not protect her.
""The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant's burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant's testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee. Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); see also Chuilu Liu, 575 F.3d at 196-97. In this case, it was reasonable for the agency to require Lara-Guzman to corroborate her testimony: Lara-Guzman's abuser is not listed as the father of her children on their birth certificates and her vacillating testimony on the matter did not resolve the issue; and she admitted she does not know why she fears returning to Honduras after her abuser's death. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks, citation, and emphasis omitted)).
The agency identified the missing evidence and gave Lara-Guzman the opportunity to obtain it. Lara-Guzman did not attempt to obtain her medical records even after she learned that the medical clinic would not release them to her grandmother. See Chuilu Liu, 575 F.3d at 197-98 (""[W]e review with substantial deference an IJ's determination that corroborating evidence was reasonably available to the applicant . . . . [who] bears the ultimate burden of introducing such evidence without prompting from the IJ.""). Lara-Guzman did not ask for statements from her cousins, brothers, or classmates, all of whom she said had witnessed or knew of her abuse. See id. Lara-Guzman's mother did not provide a corroborating statement; Lara-Guzman believes that her mother is upset about the abuse Lara-Guzman suffered. Furthermore, Lara-Guzman did not submit a threatening Facebook message she purportedly received from her abuser's friend. She claimed to have deleted the message while saving the picture of her abuser's dead body that accompanied it. The IJ was not compelled to credit a digital forensics consultant's statement that it was unlikely the message could be retrieved from the archives of Lara-Guzman's Facebook account; the consultant did not examine that account or Lara-Guzman's phone.
The IJ also did not err in giving diminished weight to a domestic violence complaint and protective order Lara-Guzman submitted: she submitted only photocopies and she could not recall if she had filed any other complaints with police. See Immigr. Ct. Prac. Manual § 3.3(d)(iii) (requiring the alien to make originals available); see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that determination of the weight of evidence is largely a matter of agency discretion).
Accordingly, the agency did not err in concluding that Lara-Guzman failed to satisfy her burden of demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); Chuilu Liu, 575 F.3d at 196-98. That finding is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three forms of relief are based on the same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).[*] We do not consider the agency's alternative basis for denying relief—its determination that Lara-Guzman's claimed fear of future persecution was speculative. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (""As a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach."").
Because Lara-Guzman did not establish past persecution, she is ineligible for humanitarian asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii); see also Kone v. Holder, 596 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that humanitarian asylum ""is reserved for persecuted aliens whose persecution was particularly severe or who may suffer `other serious harm' if removed"").
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).
[*]   The IJ denied CAT relief based on Lara-Guzman's failure to satisfy the lower burden for asylum with adequate corroborating evidence. Therefore, contrary to the Government's contention, Lara-Guzman's challenge to the IJ's lack of corroboration finding necessarily challenges the denial of CAT relief.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

Alejandro Garcia Garcia (""Garcia"") petitions for review of his order of removal to the Dominican Republic. Upon due consideration, it is hereby ORDERED that the petition is GRANTED and the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with this order.
On January 14, 2013, the government instituted removal proceedings against Garcia, a Dominican Republic national who was lawfully brought into the United States in 1965 as a thirteen-month old. The IJ found Garcia removable because of five prior convictions: 1) a 1993 conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree for attempting to sell PCP in violation of New York Penal Law (""N.Y.P.L."") §§ 110.00 and 220.31; 2) a September 1996 conviction for theft of services for jumping a subway turnstile in violation of N.Y.P.L. § 165.15; 3) a December 1996 conviction for the same thing; 4) a 1998 conviction for attempted assault in the third degree in violation of N.Y.P.L. §§ 110.00 and 120.00; and 5) a 1999 conviction for petit larceny in violation of N.Y.P.L. § 155.25. The IJ found that 1) the PCP conviction constituted an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B); 2) the assault conviction had been entered pursuant to N.Y.P.L. 120.00(1), which made it a crime involving moral turpitude; and 3) Garcia's theft of services and petit larceny convictions were crimes involving moral turpitude, which made Garcia removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). Garcia appealed the decision to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's decision holding Garcia removable as charged. A final order of removal was entered against Garcia on September 9, 2014. Garcia timely appealed. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.
We review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. See Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). ""Ordinarily, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review orders of removal based on an alien's conviction for certain offenses,"" but ""[w]e retain jurisdiction . . . to consider `questions of law,' including whether an alien's conviction qualifies as a removable offense under the immigration laws."" Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).
An alien is deportable if, among other things, at any time after admission she 1) ""is convicted of an aggravated felony,"" 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(2)(A)(iii); 2) ""is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,"" id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), or 3) ""has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance,"" id. § 1227 (a)(2)(B)(i).
On appeal, the government argues that it has three independent grounds for removing Garcia: 1) his PCP conviction is an ""aggravated felony,"" 2) all five of his convictions amount to ""crimes involving moral turpitude,"" and 3) his PCP conviction is an offense ""relating to a controlled substance.""
I. Aggravated Felony
Our recent decision in Harbin v. Sessions, 860 F.3d 58 (2d Cir. 2017), disposes of the government's argument that Garcia is removable because of an aggravated felony. There, we held that a conviction under N.Y.P.L. § 220.31 does not constitute the commission of an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, and therefore is not sufficient to make an alien removable. Id. at 61. Thus, Garcia, like Harbin, is not removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
II. Two or More Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude
A conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude (""CIMT"") if the crime is ""inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general."" Mendez v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 345, 347 (2d Cir. 2008). ""Because it is in the intent that moral turpitude inheres, the focus of the analysis is generally on the mental state reflected in the statute."" Efstathiadis v. Holder, 752 F.3d 591, 595 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To determine whether an offense is a CIMT, we employ ""a categorical approach that `look[s] not to the facts of' the particular case, `but instead to whether [the offense] categorically fits within' the definition of a CIMT."" Id. (quoting Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 1678, 1684 (2013)). ""The comparison of elements that the categorical approach requires is straightforward when a statute sets out a single (or `indivisible') set of elements to define a single crime."" Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016). In that case, we ""line[] up that crime's elements alongside those of the generic offense and see[] if they match."" Id. If instead the criminal statute at issue ""list[s] elements in the alternative,"" we employ the so called modified categorical approach and ""look[] to a limited class of documents (for example, the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement and colloquy) to determine what crime, with what elements, a defendant was convicted of."" Id. at 2249. Once the particular crime of conviction is identified in this manner, the categorical approach is then applied to that crime to determine whether it is a CIMT. See id.
Here, the IJ concluded that Garcia's convictions were CIMTs without discussing the statutes under which Garcia was convicted or determining whether the categorical or modified categorical approach applied. Likewise, all the BIA included to support its finding that Garcia's crimes were CIMTs was a single sentence and a string of citations to cases that, as we discuss below, do not fully support its findings. The BIA's reasoning thus was too cursory to support its conclusion that Garcia's convictions were CIMTs. See Johnson v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 164, 169 (2d Cir. 2004) (""The BIA is required to follow the law, including . . . BIA precedents. . . ."").
A. Theft of Services
It is not clear that theft of services under N.Y.P.L. § 165.15(3) is a CIMT. Here, the agency concluded N.Y.P.L. § 165.15(3) was a CIMT merely by citing Matter of Jurado, 24 I. & N. Dec. 29, 33 (BIA 2006), for the proposition that theft and larceny offenses involve moral turpitude. See 24 I. & N. Dec. at 33-34 (holding that retail theft under Pennsylvania law is a CIMT because it ""requires proof that the person took merchandise offered for sale by a store without paying for it and with the intention of depriving the store owner of the goods""). The BIA never compared the Pennsylvania statute at issue in Jurado with N.Y.P.L. § 165.15(3), nor did it address whether turnstile jumping also requires a permanent taking or whether a theft that does not involve a permanent taking constitutes a CIMT. Accordingly, ""we remand the case to the BIA to consider, in the first instance"" whether theft of services in violation of N.Y.P.L. § 165.15(3) is categorically a CIMT. Butt v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 130, 131 (2d Cir. 2007).
B. Petit Larceny
The BIA's CIMT analysis of Garcia's petit larceny offense is similarly flawed. That analysis also relied on Jurado for the proposition that theft and larceny involve moral turpitude. Once again, the BIA did not compare the Pennsylvania retail offense implicated in Jurado to N.Y.P.L. § 155.25, or analyze the text of the New York statute to determine whether petit larceny requires the intent to take property permanently. And, as with theft of services, it is not clear whether petit larceny is a CIMT. Although we have observed that the crime of petit larceny has historically been considered a CIMT, Brett v. INS, 386 F.2d 439, 439 (2d Cir. 1967), we have said that, under BIA precedent, ""not all larcenies are CIMTs,"" because larceny constitutes a CIMT ""only when a permanent taking is intended."" Wala, 511 F.3d at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted). We also note that the BIA recently held in an unpublished decision that a petit larceny conviction under N.Y.P.L. § 155.25 categorically involves moral turpitude because ""New York case law . . . expressly states that the intent to permanently deprive, or virtually permanently deprive, the owner of his or her property is necessary to sustain a petit larceny conviction."" Matter of Rafael Eduardo Gonzalez Pena, 2016 WL 1722550, at *2 (BIA Mar. 30, 2016). Since that decision was unpublished, however, we do not defer to it. See Rotimi v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 55, 56 (2d Cir. 2007). Thus, a remand is likewise warranted for the BIA to consider whether petit larceny is a CIMT or to apply an intervening decision in the case we remanded for the same purpose in Obeya v. Holder. 572 F. App'x 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order) (""[W]e remand for the BIA to determine in the first instance whether Obeya's conviction under N.Y.P.L. § 155.25 constitutes a CIMT."").
C. Attempted Assault
The BIA's CIMT analysis of Garcia's attempted third-degree assault conviction is flawed for a different reason: it is not clear that it was established that his conviction was under subpart one of N.Y.P.L. § 120.00. This matters because subpart one is the only portion of that provision that the BIA has previously determined constitutes a CIMT. See Matter of Solon, 24 I. & N. Dec. 239, 245 (BIA 2007). At the removal proceedings, the IJ asked Garcia, ""is it also true you were convicted of attempted assault in the third degree . . . and that was under Subdivision (1)?"" Garcia responded, ""Yeah, I got into a fight. Nothing violent. Just a fight."" App'x at 103. That concession is too vague to confirm that his conviction was under subpart one. Nor does the record of conviction clarify the matter. First, the certificate of disposition does not specify any subpart. Second, although the rap sheet states that the conviction was under subpart one, a rap sheet alone is not conclusive proof of a conviction. See Francis v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 131, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the combination of Garcia's testimony and the record of conviction does not necessarily support the conclusion that Garcia was convicted under N.Y.P.L. § 120.00(1). Thus, remand is warranted for the BIA's further consideration of whether Garcia was convicted under N.Y.P.L. § 120.00(1), and, if necessary, whether a conviction under another subsection constitutes a CIMT.
III. Relating to a Controlled Substance
The government argues that the BIA affirmed the IJ finding that Garcia was removable under the provision of the INA stating that an alien is removable if he was ""convicted of a violation . . . relating to a controlled substance,"" 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(2)(B)(i), when the BIA ""affirm[ed] the holding that the DHS . . . established removability as charged."" App'x at 4. In the alternative, the government argues that Garcia waived any challenge to removability on this ground because he did not raise the issue in his opening brief, and that ""there can be no argument that a conviction for attempting to sell a controlled substance does not `relate' to a controlled substance offense."" Resp't's Br. at 25.
This is unpersuasive. First, it is true that we do not generally consider arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs, see Booking v. Gen. Star Mgmt. Co., 254 F.3d 414, 418 (2d Cir. 2001), but this rule is not jurisdictional, see United States v. Barnes, 158 F.3d 662, 672 (2d Cir. 1998). Additionally, none of the concerns animating that rule are implicated here. For one, there is no reason that the government would be prejudiced by not having an opportunity to respond to this argument because the government discusses the argument in its brief. Moreover, neither the IJ nor the BIA discussed whether Garcia was removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(2)(B)(i) in its opinion, so there is good reason to be concerned that Garcia—as he claims in his reply brief—was not on notice that this was a ground on which the IJ deemed him removable.
Even if the BIA did find that Garcia's PCP conviction ""relat[ed] to a controlled substance,"" the BIA did not properly consider the issue. We have held that ""N.Y.P.L. § 220.31 defines a single crime and is therefore an `indivisible' statute."" Harbin, 860 F.3d at 61. To determine whether an alien is removable because of a conviction under an indivisible state statute, an agency applies the ""categorical approach."" Id. The BIA thus could not have properly come to the conclusion that Garcia is removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(2)(B)(i) without analyzing whether Garcia's conviction categorically is a conviction ""relating to a controlled substance."" See Mellouli v. Lynch, 135 S. Ct. 1980, 1987-89 (2015). We also note that it is not true that there is ""no argument"" that a conviction under this statute is not one relating to a controlled substance offense. See Swaby v. Yates, 847 F.3d 62, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2017). Still, we think it best to leave consideration of this issue in the first instance to the BIA given its expertise in construing its own statute and our belief that doing so is generally ""the wiser and more prudent course."" See James v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 250, 256 (2d Cir. 2008).
IV. 212(c) waiver
To be eligible for a § 212(c) waiver for a pre-1997 conviction, a noncitizen must be a lawful permanent resident with a lawful domicile for at least seven continuous years, and not have been convicted of an aggravated felony for which he or she has served a term of imprisonment of at least five years. See United States v. Gill, 748 F.3d 491, 498, 503-04 (2d Cir. 2014); see also INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). Garcia is eligible for a § 212(c) waiver for his drug conviction because he pleaded guilty in 1993, was placed in removal proceedings after 1997, and was sentenced to only 18 months to 3 years of imprisonment.[1] Accordingly, if the BIA finds that Garcia's other convictions do not constitute two or more CIMTs, the agency must also address whether Garcia warrants a § 212(c) waiver as a matter of discretion. See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir. 2006).
For these reasons, we VACATE the BIA's order of removal and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this order. Garcia's outstanding motion to remand is DISMISSED as moot.
[1]  Before the BIA, Garcia did not argue that his September 1996 and December 1996 convictions for theft of services were eligible for a 212(c) waiver. Thus, this claim is unexhausted. Although not jurisdictional, issue exhaustion is mandatory. See Zhong v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Foster v. I.N.S., 376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004) (""To preserve a claim, we require petitioner to raise issues to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, we do not consider whether those convictions are eligible for a 212(c) waiver.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment entered on September 16, 2016, is VACATED and REMANDED IN PART as to forfeiture, and AFFIRMED in all other respects.
Defendant Dionysius Fiumano was convicted after a jury trial of substantive and conspiratorial wire fraud, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 1349, and 2, in connection with an advance-fee mortgage modification scheme involving thousands of victims, many of whom lost their homes as a result of the fraud. On appeal, Fiumano challenges only his sentence, which ordered concurrent 16-year prison terms as well as forfeiture and restitution, each in the amount of $11,975,404.13. We assume the parties' familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm in part and vacate in part.
1. The Prison Terms
Fiumano argues that his total 16-year prison sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We first address his procedural challenge, which asserts Guidelines calculation error. See United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc).
a. Procedural Error
(1) Sophisticated Means Enhancement
Because Fiumano first challenges the application of a sophisticated means enhancement on appeal, see U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C), we review only for plain error, see United States v. Hertular, 562 F.3d 433, 449 (2d Cir. 2009), which is not evident here. The district court's purported failure to explain its application of this enhancement, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c), warrants no remand because the court expressly adopted the findings in Fiumano's Pre-Sentence Report (""PSR""), which provided satisfactory factual support, see United States v. Espinoza, 514 F.3d 209, 212 (2d Cir. 2008). Indeed, the Guidelines' own example of sophisticated means—a telemarketing scheme in which the main office and soliciting operations are in separate jurisdictions, see U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n.9(B)—precisely mirrors the conduct here.
Fiumano cannot urge otherwise by arguing that he was a mere ""salesman."" Appellant Br. at 28. Although this court has held that sophisticated means is an offense characteristic, not a characteristic of an individual defendant, see United States v. Lewis, 93 F.3d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir. 1996), for purposes of this decision we assume arguendo that the Sentencing Commission's 2015 amendment of the sophisticated means enhancement requires us to look to Fiumano's own conduct in assessing the appropriateness of this enhancement, see U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C) (requiring defendant himself to have ""intentionally engaged in or caused conduct constituting sophisticated means""). When we do so, we have no difficulty concluding that there was sufficient evidence of Fiumano's intentional conduct that the district court's application of the enhancement was not plain error. Specifically, Fiumano's orchestration of, and participation in, the ""company flips,"" used by the schemers to evade victims and law enforcement, demonstrates his personal engagement in conduct constituting sophisticated means.
(2) Abuse-of-Private-Trust Enhancement
As for Fiumano's challenge to the application of an abuse-of-private-trust enhancement, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, we need not resolve the parties' dispute as to whether our review is also limited to plain error because Fiumano fails to show any error at all. The district court's adoption of the PSR obviates the need to remand for an explanation of reasons for this enhancement, and Fiumano's substantive challenge to the enhancement is meritless. He argues that because he did not deal directly with victims, they did not view him as personally holding a position of trust. But Fiumano does not—and cannot—dispute trial evidence showing that telemarketers, acting at his direction and using scripts he prepared, induced victims by falsely telling them that they would be represented by a lawyer. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 cmt. n.3 (applying enhancement to false representations of trust); United States v. Walker, 191 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 1999) (recognizing attorney to hold position of trust with regard to clients). Indeed, several victims testified that they understood from these representations that they had retained an attorney. Fiumano is responsible for confederate actions in a jointly undertaken scheme, see U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (stating that in case of ""jointly undertaken criminal activity,"" defendant is responsible for all acts and omissions of others ""reasonably foreseeable"" to have been within scope and in furtherance of that jointly undertaken activity), most particularly when taken at his direction, see generally 18 U.S.C. § 2. Accordingly, we identify no error in application of the § 3B1.3 enhancement.
(3) Role Enhancement
Fiumano challenges application of the four-level enhancement for organizers and leaders of criminal activities involving five or more participants, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), arguing that only a two-level role enhancement was warranted, see id. § 3B1.1(c), particularly given the purported greater roles of other co-conspirators. The argument merits little discussion. Fiumano does not dispute that the scheme involved five or more participants, and the Guidelines themselves make clear that more than one person can qualify as a leader or organizer of a criminal scheme. See id. § 3B1.1 cmt. n.4; United States v. Wisniewski, 121 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 1997). The record easily admits a preponderance finding that Fiumano was an organizer or leader of the scheme. See United States v. Salazar, 489 F.3d 555, 557-58 (2d Cir. 2007). Evidence showed that Fiumano did more than manage or supervise the telemarketers and sales managers essential to the scheme. He recruited a significant number of such participants and exercised considerable discretion in instructing them on the misrepresentations they were to make to victims, conduct indicative of a leader or organizer. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 cmt. n.4; United States v. Chavez, 549 F.3d 119, 136 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding four-level enhancement appropriate where defendant instructed lower level co-conspirator on dilution of narcotics); United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 104 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding four-level enhancement appropriate where defendant recruited accomplices). Further, he earned more than a half-million dollars from the scheme, which, even if not the highest amount earned by any participant—a point disputed by the parties—was ""a larger share of the fruits of the crime"" than that of most other participants. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 cmt. n.4. Accordingly, a four-level role enhancement was warranted.
(4) Loss Amount
Fiumano argues that the district court committed procedural error in applying a 20-level enhancement to his Guidelines calculation based on the PSR's loss report of $11,975,404.13. See U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(K) (pertaining to losses exceeding $9.5 million up to $25 million). He contends that only an 18-level enhancement was warranted. See id. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(J) (pertaining to losses exceeding $3.5 million up to $9.5 million).[1] The point merits little discussion because this loss argument was made to the district court, which plainly chose not to resolve it because the precise loss figure was ""immaterial"" to its decision to vary substantially below either Guidelines range to impose a total 16-year prison term. JA 316, 324. Where the district court makes such an explicit and unambiguous declaration that a particular enhancement did not affect its ultimate sentence, we need not decide a procedural challenge to the enhancement's application. See United States v. Jass, 569 F.3d 47, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (""Where we identify procedural error in a sentence, but the record indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event, the error may be deemed harmless, avoiding the need to vacate the sentence and to remand the case for resentencing."" (internal quotation marks omitted)); accord United States v. Feldman, 647 F.3d 450, 459 (2d Cir. 2011). Fiumano's arguments urging us not to take the district court at its word are unconvincing. The record amply manifests the district court's careful consideration of all relevant factors—mitigating as well as aggravating—in exercising its ultimate discretion to sentence Fiumano not within any Guidelines range, but to the 16-year term of incarceration that it thought best served the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 50 (2007) (stating that sentencing court ""may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable"" but must itself determine sentence that serves interests stated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)); United States v. Jones, 531 F.3d 163, 182 (2d Cir. 2008).
b. Substantive Unreasonableness
Fiumano argues that his 16-year prison sentence is substantively unreasonable.
We will identify substantive unreasonableness only in those ""exceptional cases,"" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189, where the sentence is ""so `shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law' that allowing [it] to stand would `damage the administration of justice,'"" United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 289 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2009)). A Guidelines sentence will rarely raise such concerns; a below-Guidelines sentence even less so. See United States v. Perez-Frias, 636 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir. 2011).[2] This is not an exceptional case warranting a different conclusion.
As the district court reasonably observed, Fiumano played a leadership role over a number of years in ""a callous and heartless mortgage modification scheme"" in which thousands of victims were defrauded by misrepresentations crafted by Fiumano and conveyed by scores of people whom he supervised. JA 314-15. Many of the victims lost their homes as a result of the fraud, suffering ""enormous"" emotional as well as financial harm. Id. at 318. Meanwhile, Fiumano earned more than a half-million dollars from his crime. On this record, and mindful of the ""due deference"" owed to the sentencing judge's exercise of discretion, United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190, we cannot conclude that a total prison sentence of 16 years is so shocking as to be substantively unreasonable.
No different conclusion is compelled by lesser sentences imposed in other fraud cases or on certain of Fiumano's co-defendants. While a district court is statutorily required to consider ""the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,"" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), the weight to give this, or any other § 3553(a) factor, is a matter committed to the district court's discretion and generally unreviewable on appeal. See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. at 56; United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191 (stating that appellate courts ""do not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor,"" but decide only whether factor ""can bear the weight assigned"" by district court). Such deference is particularly warranted here, where Fiumano has failed to show that his crime is clearly analogous to those involved in the comparator cases he cites, whether in terms of his particular leadership role, the scope of the fraud, and the particularly serious harm—emotional as well as financial—inflicted on thousands of victims. See United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 254 (2d Cir. 2012) (rejecting disparity challenge where there was no showing that defendants were ""similarly situated""). Much less can Fiumano complain of disparity with his co-defendants, see United States v. Johnson, 567 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2009) (stating that district court ""may—but is not required to—consider sentencing disparity among co-defendants under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)""), whose guilty pleas and cooperation with the government make them not similarly situated to Fiumano, see United States v. Fernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 30-33 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that disparity among non-similarly situated co-defendants manifests no § 3553(a)(6) error).
Accordingly, because Fiumano's prison sentence is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, his argument for vacatur and remand fails.
2. Forfeiture
The parties agree that the forfeiture order imposing joint and several liability on Fiumano in the amount of $11,975,404.13, representing the entire amount of the scheme's proceeds, must be vacated in light of Honeycutt v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 1626, 1630 (2017) (holding that defendant cannot be held ""jointly and severally liable for property that his co-conspirator derived from the crime but that the defendant himself did not acquire"").[3] But while the government asks us to direct the district court, on remand, to order forfeiture in the reduced amount of $593,605.88, constituting the amount Fiumano was paid during his employment with PMG, Fiumano contends that the district court should be ordered to conduct a new hearing as to the proper forfeiture amount, but with a cap of $593,605.88. He does not dispute that he was paid this amount, or that all PMG revenues came from victims of the fraud scheme. Rather, he argues that a hearing is necessary because certain victims received legitimate document preparation services, such that Fiumano's forfeiture should be reduced by the amount these victims paid to PMG.[4]
Fiumano's argument is defeated by trial testimony showing that document-preparation victims were falsely told that an ""underwriter"" had reviewed the victims' loan files and that they would likely qualify for loan modifications, when Fiumano and his co-conspirators knew that no such review had occurred and that these victims were poor candidates for loan modification. Because document-preparation victims thus parted with their $595 based on lies concocted by Fiumano and his confederates, these victims most assuredly did not receive the services for which they bargained. See United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 579 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding that victim sustains loss from fraud if defendant intends his misrepresentation to induce victim to enter transaction without relevant facts necessary to make informed economic decision). Accordingly, because the only conclusion admitted by the evidence is that all of Fiumano's compensation ""constituted or derived from proceeds traceable to [the fraud],"" it is subject to forfeiture. 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C).
3. Restitution
The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (""MVRA"") requires a district court to order a defendant to make restitution to identifiable victims of the crime of conviction who have suffered a pecuniary loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(B). Such restitution can be ordered jointly and severally. See United States v. Zangari, 677 F.3d 86, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2012). Fiumano nevertheless urges us to vacate the $11,975,404.13 restitution order in his case, arguing that it (1) holds him responsible for losses occurring before he joined the charged conspiracy, (2) includes payments made by document-preparation victims who sustained no loss, and (3) fails to identify victims and their losses individually. Because Fiumano did not object to the restitution order before the district court, we review only for plain error, which is not evident here. See United States v. Boyd, 222 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir. 2000).
Fiumano's first argument is defeated by the very case on which he relies: United States v. Bengis, 783 F.3d 407 (2d Cir. 2015). Bengis reaffirmed the principle that if a defendant who joins a conspiracy ""knew or reasonably should have known about some or all of the conspiracy's past [criminal conduct], his restitution order should encompass"" past loss amounts. Id. at 413. The trial record here shows that, prior to joining PMG, Fiumano worked for co-conspirator Pedram Abghari at Clear Blue, where they and others ran a nearly identical fraud scheme to the one they would conduct at PMG. Indeed, it was when Abghari left Clear Blue to open his new fraudulent enterprise, PMG, that he selected Fiumano to run Clear Blue's sales staff. Thus, when Abghari recruited Fiumano to join the PMG fraud scheme, Fiumano knew or reasonably should have known that fraudulent activity had transpired there prior to his arrival. On these facts, we identify no plain error in the district court's decision to order Fiumano to make restitution for the entire length of the charged conspiracy.
Fiumano's second challenge warrants no different conclusion because, as we have already held, trial evidence compels the conclusion that fraudulent representations induced document-preparation victims to part with their money, and thus they are entitled to restitution. We need not address Fiumano's arguments as to the availability of data about such victims in PMG's file storage system, because nothing in his arguments suggests that the data would alter the fact of misrepresentation.[5]
Fiumano argues that the $11,975,404.13 restitution order represents losses suffered by all fraud victims, who number in the thousands. He submits that, at sentencing, the government identified only 100 victims of the fraud, thereby violating precedent prohibiting lump-sum restitution orders. See United States v. Zakhary, 357 F.3d 186, 190 (2d Cir. 2004) (""A lump sum restitution order entered without any identification of victims and their actual losses is not permissible.""); United States v. Catoggio, 326 F.3d 323, 328 (2d Cir. 2003) (holding ""that restitution can only be imposed to the extent that the victims of a crime are actually identified""). At sentencing, the district court stated that it had ""received victim impact statements from over 100 victims."" JA 314. But the restitution order itself states that ""the names, addresses, and specific amounts owed to the victims are set forth in the Schedule of Victims and Restitution attached hereto."" SPA 8. Thus, while the 100 victims who submitted victim impact statements may be among those included on the Schedule of Victims and Restitution, this does not mean that only 100 victims are there identified.[6] Having failed to produce the Schedule of Victims and Restitution as part of the appellate record, Fiumano can hardly show clear, much less plain, error in the district court's restitution order.
We have considered Fiumano's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we VACATE only so much of the judgment of conviction as orders forfeiture, and we REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of ordering forfeiture in the amount of $593,605.88. In all other respects, the judgment is AFFIRMED.
[1]  The higher enhancement, considered together with all other Guidelines factors, resulted in a recommended term of life imprisonment, which was capped by the statutory maximum prison sentence of 40 years. The lower enhancement would yield a Guidelines sentencing range of 324-405 months' imprisonment. See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.
[2]  Fiumano's 16-year (192-month) sentence is significantly below both the capped 40-year Guidelines range derived from the application of a 20-level loss enhancement and the 324- to 405-month range derived from the application of an 18-level enhancement.
[3]  In light of the government's concession, we need not here decide whether Honeycutt's ruling, made with respect to a forfeiture order under 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1), applies equally in all respects to forfeiture orders under other statutes, including 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C), applicable here.
[4]  PMG purported to offer its victims two types of services: full modification service for a fee of $3,000, and document preparation service for a fee of $595. As to the former, victims were told that an attorney would submit loan modification documents to and negotiate with the bank on the victim's behalf. As to the latter, victims were told PMG would prepare an application that the victim would submit.
[5]  For this reason, Fiumano's motion to expand the record on appeal to include an affidavit concerning the availability of this data, see Dkt. No. 40, is hereby DENIED.
[6]  Indeed, at oral argument, the government produced the Schedule of Victims and Restitution, which in fact listed, by name and address, thousands of victims of the scheme and the amount of their losses, which more than justified the restitution amount determined by the district court, and counsel for Fiumano acknowledged the accuracy of the document presented by the government. Fiumano's argument thus appears to be entirely inaccurate.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
Petitioner Fabian Martin, a native and citizen of Colombia, seeks review of the BIA's affirmance of an Immigration Judge's (""IJ's"") denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Fabian R. Martin, No. A079 252 661 (B.I.A. Oct. 28, 2015), aff'g No. A079 252 661 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. Mar. 12, 2014). Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ's decision as supplemented by the BIA, see Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005), applying well-established standards of review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Yanqin Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir. 2009). In so doing, we assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to deny the petition in part and to dismiss the petition in part.
I. Asylum
We dismiss Martin's petition as it relates to the agency's pretermission of his asylum application as untimely. An asylum application must be filed within one year of an applicant's arrival in the United States, absent changed or extraordinary circumstances. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). Although we lack jurisdiction to review the agency's pretermission of asylum on timeliness grounds, we retain jurisdiction to review ""constitutional claims or questions of law."" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). In order to ascertain whether a petitioner raises such a constitutional challenge or question of law, we must determine ""whether [the petition] merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual finding or justification for the discretionary choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction."" Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir. 2006).
Martin's assertion that the BIA failed to consider the facts and circumstances of his case is contradicted by the record and merely quarrels with the correctness of the agency's discretionary determination that he failed to file his application within a reasonable time of what the agency assumed to be an exceptional circumstance—Martin's mistaken belief that his 2002 application for adjustment of status was an asylum application. See id. As the agency observed, even if Martin mistakenly believed that his application to adjust status was an asylum application, that application was denied in 2004, and Martin failed to pursue an asylum claim until filing his asylum application more than 7 years later in 2012. Moreover, while Martin now contends that he filed an asylum application before applying to adjust status, he specifically identified his adjustment application as what he believed to be his prior asylum application. Because Martin fails to raise a constitutional or legal challenge to the agency pretermission of asylum, we lack jurisdiction to review that determination.
II. Withholding of Removal
To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an applicant must show a likelihood that his ""life or freedom would be threatened in [Colombia] because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); see id. § 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a likelihood of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1).
Although the Immigration and Nationality Act does not define persecution, see Baba v. Holder, 569 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 2009), the BIA has defined it as a ""threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who differ in a way regarded as offensive."" Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 222 (B.I.A. 1985), overruled in part on other grounds by INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987); accord Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir. 2006). Past persecution can be based on harm other than threats to life or freedom, including non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse, see Beskovic v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 223, 226 n.3 (2d Cir. 2006), but the harm must be sufficiently severe to rise above ""mere harassment,"" Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d at 341. The difference between harassment and persecution is ""necessarily one of degree that must be decided on a case-by-case basis."" Id. Unfulfilled threats alone do not constitute persecution. See Ci Pan v. U.S. Att'y General, 449 F.3d 408, 412-13 (2d Cir. 2006).
First, the agency did not err in concluding that Martin failed to establish past persecution. See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d at 340-41. Given that Martin's testimony lacked any details regarding the beating he asserted in his application, he did not testify that he suffered any injuries or sought medical treatment, and any threats he received were ultimately unfulfilled, the agency did not err in concluding that Martin failed to establish that his past harm rose to the level of persecution. See id.; Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2011) (finding no error in the agency's determination that an alien failed to establish past persecution when ""he suffered only minor bruising from an altercation with family planning officials, which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect"").
Second, Martin fails to challenge the agency's determination that he did not independently demonstrate a likelihood of future persecution. This claim is therefore waived. See Norton v. Sam's Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998) (""Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal."").
Third, Martin also fails to challenge the BIA's determination that he did not establish a nexus between his proposed social group—individuals who are persecuted by a group the government of Colombia could not control—and the harm he suffered and feared. He has therefore waived review of this determination, which is entirely dispositive of his withholding claim. See id.; Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d 191, 195 (2d Cir. 2014) (""To succeed on a particular social group claim, the applicant must establish both that the group itself was cognizable, and that the alleged persecutors targeted the applicant `on account of' her membership in that group."" (emphasis added) (citations omitted)).
Accordingly, because Martin did not show that he was persecuted or would be persecuted, or that any harm would be on account of his social group membership, the agency did not err in denying withholding of removal. See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d at 340-41; Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d at 195.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction as to asylum and DENIED in remaining part.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Rosamma Saji (""Saji"") appeals from a February 28, 2017 judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, disposing of her suit after a partial grant of the defendant's motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and a grant of the defendant's motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Saji—a woman of Indian descent—filed this suit against the Nassau University Medical Center (""NUMC""), a public teaching hospital located in Nassau County, New York.[1] Saji claims, inter alia, that NUMC discriminated against her on the basis of national origin, and retaliated against her due to her opposition to NUMC's alleged discriminatory practices. She seeks relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law § 296 et seq. (""NYSHRL""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
A. Standard of Review
""We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, `resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.'"" Nick's Garage, Inc. v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 875 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal brackets omitted) (quoting Johnson v. Killian, 680 F.3d 234, 236 (2d Cir. 2012) (per curiam)). Summary judgment is proper ""if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that] the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). ""A genuine issue of material fact exists if `the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'"" Pollard v. N.Y. Methodist Hosp., 861 F.3d 374, 378 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). ""[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (emphasis in original). As a result, ""reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion."" Davis v. New York, 316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002). A court may grant a motion for summary judgment if, ""even after drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], no reasonable jury could have issued a verdict in [her] favor."" Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005).
We review a district court's decision to grant a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. See Gomez v. City of New York, 805 F.3d 419, 423 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam). But when a Rule 59(e) motion results in the grant of a motion for summary judgment, we review the merits of the district court's decision de novo. See AEP Energy Servs. Gas Holding Co. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 626 F.3d 699, 739 n.21 (2d Cir. 2010); Lowrance v. Achtyl, 20 F.3d 529, 534 (2d Cir. 1994).
B. Saji's Claim of Retaliation for NUMC's Failure to Re-Hire
Saji first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to NUMC on her claim that NUMC failed to re-hire her as a form of retaliation for her March 28, 2012 letter. We evaluate retaliation claims under Title VII and the NYSHRL using the three-step ""burden-shifting evidentiary framework"" outlined by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 315 (2d Cir. 2015); Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro & Assocs. Consulting Eng'rs, P.C., 716 F.3d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 2013) (""The standards for evaluating . . . retaliation claims are identical under Title VII and the NYSHRL.""). At step one, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing ""a prima facie case of retaliation."" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 164 (2d Cir. 2010). A plaintiff does so by demonstrating four elements: ""(1) participation in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action."" Id. (quoting Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir. 2005)). The plaintiff's burden at this stage is ""de minimis."" Id. (quoting Jute, 420 F.3d at 173). If the plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, a ""presumption of retaliation"" arises. Id. (quoting Jute, 420 F.3d at 173). To rebut this presumption (i.e., step two), the defendant must ""articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action."" Id. (quoting Jute, 420 F.3d at 173). If the defendant does so, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff. See id. At this point (i.e., step three), the plaintiff must show that the reason offered by the employer is merely pretext, and that the employer's ""desire to retaliate"" was the actual ""but-for cause of the challenged employment action."" Ya-Chen Chen v. City Univ. of New York, 805 F.3d 59, 70 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2528 (2013)). If the plaintiff fails to do so, her claims are dismissed. See id.
The district court initially determined that a genuine dispute of material fact existed at step three. It noted that NUMC had posted a position for an RN-IV—and removed that post—just weeks after Saji sent her letter, and that NUMC hired a full-time RN-IV on October 9, 2012, a mere six months later. It accordingly held that ""the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action is such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that notwithstanding the non-retaliatory reasons proffered by [NUMC], [Saji] would have been rehired if not for her complaint of discrimination."" Special App'x at 38.
After NUMC filed a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration, however, the district court determined that it erred in two ways. First, it failed to consider that Saji herself conceded that she was unqualified for the October 9, 2012 full-time RN-IV position. Next, and after setting aside the October 9, 2012 evidence as ""neutral"" for this reason, the district court concluded that Saji's entire case consisted of the ""temporal proximity"" between her March 28, 2012 letter and the April 2012 job posting and removal. Special App'x at 49. Correctly recognizing that ""[t]emporal proximity alone is insufficient to defeat summary judgment at the pretext stage,"" Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 847 (2d Cir. 2013), the district court held that Saji failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her March 28, 2012 letter was the ""but-for"" cause of NUMC's failure to re-hire her in April 2012.
Saji raises two objections to the district court's reasoning, neither of which has merit. First, Saji alleges that although NUMC never directly filled the full-time RN-IV job posting from April 16, 2012, NUMC did indirectly fill the posting by hiring multiple per diem RN-IVs. Saji's only source for this proposition, however, is her own conclusory allegation in an affidavit she submitted to the district court. See Br. for Pl.-Appellant at 24 (citing App'x at 168, ¶ 24). She offers no evidence to support the allegation, and after searching the record we could not find any such evidence. See Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 (explaining that a party ""may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation"" to oppose a motion for summary judgment (quoting Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp., 247 F.3d 423, 428 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Even if her allegation were true, however, Saji articulates no convincing reason to believe that her March 28, 2012 letter was the ""but-for"" cause of NUMC's decision. See Ya-Chen Chen, 805 F.3d at 70. If anything, the fact that NUMC ultimately replaced a full-time RN-IV position with multiple per diem RN-IV positions would support NUMC's contention that Saji's letter had no connection to its decision not to re-hire her. Saji does not dispute that unlike permanent RN-IVs, per diem RN-IVs are hired on an ""as-needed"" basis and receive no salary. The evidence would therefore strongly suggest that NUMC decided to forgo a full-time RN-IV in favor of multiple per diem RN-IVs as a cost-saving measure. Indeed, NUMC explained to the district court that the Nassau Health Care Corporation had specifically instructed NUMC to eliminate a permanent RN-IV position, and Saji has failed to put forward evidence to rebut this contention. At the very least, no reasonable jury could be persuaded that NUMC would have re-hired Saji—less than two months after firing her—""but for"" her letter. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252 (""The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff."").
Second, Saji argues that her case turns on questions of NUMC's intent, a factual issue ""which inherently requires a credibility determination by the jury."" Br. for Pl.-Appellant at 24. But to defeat a motion for summary judgment, Saji ""must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."" Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)). Rather, she ""must offer some hard evidence showing that [her] version of the events is not wholly fanciful."" D'Amico v. City of N.Y., 132 F.3d 145, 149 (2d Cir. 1998). Saji has failed to do so, and the district court therefore correctly granted NUMC's motion for summary judgment on her ""failure-to-hire"" retaliation claim.
C. Saji's Claim of Retaliation for NUMC's Failure to Agree to the Union Stipulation
Saji also argues that she raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether, in retaliation for her March 28, 2012 letter, NUMC reneged on an agreement to expunge a disciplinary charge from her employment record. The district court determined that NUMC's decision ""not to finalize the settlement agreement"" that would have expunged Saji's disciplinary charge was not an ""adverse employment action."" Special App'x at 34. The court explained that Plaintiff was ""no longer employed at the time of the March 26, 2012 meeting at which the tentative agreement was negotiated, and NUMC's decision not to execute the agreement in no way affects Plaintiff's reputation or future employment."" Id. at 34. Saji argues that the district court's analysis was faulty, because NUMC's decision not to expunge the disciplinary charge did affect her reputation and potential future employment. See, e.g., Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 173 (2011) (explaining that Title VII's antiretaliation provision ""must be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct""); Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 108 F.3d 462, 465 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting that an individual who has been notified that she has been terminated still retains the protections of Title VII).
However, even if we were to accept arguendo that reneging on a promise to expunge a disciplinary charge from a terminated employee's personnel file qualifies as an ""adverse employment action,"" we believe that no reasonable jury could find that NUMC made such a promise and then refused to honor it. First, there is no evidence—beyond Saji's own conclusory allegations—that NUMC ever signed the agreement in question. The NUMC representative present at the March 26, 2012 meeting swore under oath that she did not sign it. She explained that the document contained ""several errors and omissions""—such as the fact that the agreement provided nothing to NUMC in return for its promise to expunge the disciplinary charge. App'x at 55, ¶ 39. Indeed, the record contains a copy of the agreement that was allegedly distributed at the meeting, and the designated space for the NUMC representative's signature is blank. See id. at 91. Saji herself admitted that although she saw the NUMC representative sign ""some"" document, she was not sure it was the agreement. See id. at 122, 123. In addition, in May 2012, NUMC provided Saji with an alternative settlement agreement. That agreement explicitly offered to ""expunge [Saji's disciplinary charge] and reference thereto from [her] personnel file,"" as long as Saji waived any claims against NUMC related to the issue. Id. at 96-97. It is undisputed that Saji did not sign the alternative settlement agreement, negotiate with NUMC over the agreement, or even propose a counteroffer. On these facts, we do not believe that any reasonable jury could find that NUMC reneged on a promise to expunge Saji's disciplinary charge because of her March 28, 2012 letter, and we therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on this claim.
D. Saji's Discrimination Claims
Saji also argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims that, by disciplining her and firing her, NUMC discriminated against her based on her national origin. We use a similar burden-shifting analysis to evaluate claims of discrimination under Title VII and the NYSHRL as we do for claims of retaliation. See, e.g., Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2015). Specifically, to establish a prima facie claim of discrimination, the plaintiff must show that ""(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she is qualified for her position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the circumstances give rise to an inference of discrimination."" Id. at 83 (quoting Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir. 2000)). Neither party disputes that Saji's Indian origin places her in a ""protected class,"" that Saji was qualified for her RN-IV position, and that she suffered an adverse employment action. The parties do disagree, however, on the fourth factor: that is, whether there is a ""genuine dispute of material fact"" that the circumstances of Saji's employment and termination ""give rise to an inference of discrimination.""
The fourth factor of the burden-shifting analysis ""is a flexible one that can be satisfied differently in differing factual scenarios."" Chertkova v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir. 1996). For example, a plaintiff can put forward evidence of ""more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group."" Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 468 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Chambers v. TRM Copy Centers Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994)). To do so, the plaintiff must show that the comparators in question were ""similarly situated to the plaintiff `in all material respects,'"" Ruiz v. Cty. of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 494 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Shumway v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 118 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir. 1997)), including the fact that the comparators ""engaged in [similar] conduct"" to the plaintiff but were not treated as harshly, id. (quoting Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 40 (2d Cir. 2000)). Although the question of whether two individuals were ""similarly situated"" for these purposes is often a question for the jury, ""a court can properly grant summary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met."" Harlen Assocs. v. Inc. Vill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 n.2 (2d Cir. 2001).
The district court determined—correctly—that Saji failed to carry her prima facie burden of demonstrating discrimination. Saji argues that she put forward three pieces of evidence that suffice to show a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue. We are not persuaded. First, Saji argues that the district court failed to consider the fact that two non-Indian RN-IVs engaged in the same conduct as Saji, but nonetheless evaded discipline. Saji's sole evidence to support this claim, however, are her own ""conclusory statements [and] mere allegations"" in her deposition testimony, which are not enough to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See Davis, 316 F.3d at 100. As NUMC correctly notes, Saji never states that she personally observed either of these individuals engaging in the misconduct, nor did she put forward testimony from other witnesses to corroborate her claims. Furthermore, Saji herself admitted in her deposition that she did not believe NUMC's disciplinary action was motivated by discrimination. See App'x at 125. In these circumstances, the district court did not err in concluding that Saji failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue.
Saji next argues that NUMC's decision to fire Saji instead of firing non-Indian per diem RN-IVs raises a question of material fact concerning NUMC's alleged discriminatory intent. But Saji does not genuinely dispute that per diem RN-IVs cannot be ""fired,"" since they are paid hourly, receive no salary, and are hired on an ""as-needed"" basis. See App'x at 171. Saji therefore puts forward no concrete evidence to substantiate her claim that the per diem RN-IVs were ""similarly situated"" to her. In any event, Saji's argument neglects the fact that she possessed a disciplinary record and was the subject of multiple complaints. She puts forward no evidence, however, that the per diem RN-IVs had similar disciplinary histories. See Lizardo v. Denny's, Inc., 270 F.3d 94, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) (noting that the circumstances surrounding the ""similarly situated"" employees ""need not be identical [to the plaintiff's], but there should be a reasonably close resemblance of facts and circumstances"").
Finally, Saji argues that the fact that she was selected for termination over Esther Porter (""Porter""), her other permanent RN-IV co-worker, demonstrates NUMC's discriminatory intent. Again, however, Saji fails to establish that she and Porter were sufficiently ""similarly situated."" Saji puts forward no concrete evidence to rebut NUMC's contention that Porter lacked Saji's sort of disciplinary history. Saji's sole argument on appeal is that she ""had a positive record of performance at NUMC with the only discipline being false and pretextual in nature."" Br. for Pl.-Appellant at 34. But an independent arbitrator found that Saji engaged in the conduct for which she was ultimately disciplined, see App'x at 102, and Saji fails to raise a ""genuine dispute"" concerning the other complaints and instances of insubordination during her time at NUMC. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting NUMC's motion for summary judgment on Saji's discrimination claim.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Ali Asghar, a native and citizen of Pakistan, seeks review of an August 26, 2016, decision of the BIA that affirmed an April 22, 2014, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Ali Asghar, No. A077 643 048 (B.I.A. Aug. 26, 2016), aff'g No. A077 643 048 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 22, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as modified by the BIA, i.e., minus the bases for denying relief that were not challenged before, or affirmed by, the BIA. See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we do not address the IJ's conclusion that Asghar's asylum application was untimely, on which the BIA did not rely, or Asghar's claimed fear of the Taliban, which he abandoned. Id. The applicable standards of review are well established. Secaida-Rosales v. INS, 331 F.3d 297, 306-07 (2d Cir. 2003), superseded by the REAL ID Act as recognized in Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir. 2008).
Because Asghar filed his asylum application in 2003, the REAL ID Act does not apply in this case. Liang Chen v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 454 F.3d 103, 106 n.2 (2d Cir. 2006). In pre-REAL ID Act cases, an adverse credibility determination must be based on ""specific, cogent reasons"" that ""bear a legitimate nexus"" to the finding, and any discrepancy must be substantial when ""measured against the whole record."" Secaida-Rosales, 331 F.3d at 307-08.
The agency reasonably found Asghar not credible based on inconsistencies regarding whether he was a member of the Sipah-E-Sahaba Pakistan, whether he shot his father's alleged murderer, and whether he reported the events surrounding his father's murder to police. See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 395, 402-03 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that ""[a]dverse credibility determinations are appropriately based on inconsistent statements"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Asghar did not compellingly explain any of the record inconsistencies. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005).
Given these record inconsistencies that relate to the heart of Asghar's claim, the agency's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. See Secaida-Rosales, 331 F.3d at 307; see also Tu Lin, 446 F.3d at 402-03. That determination is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three claims are based on the same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

ANTHONY KNIGHT, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT STONY BROOK, Defendant-Appellee.
Docket No. 17-54-cv.
United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.
Argued: December 15, 2017.
Decided: January 29, 2018.
Plaintiff Anthony Knight, an African-American electrician, sued Defendant State University of New York at Stony Brook, alleging that Defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it terminated his employment after he reported racist graffiti in a bathroom located at his worksite. At trial, the parties disputed whether Knight qualified as an employee for purposes of Title VII. At the close of evidence, Knight moved for judgment as a matter of law that he was Defendant's employee. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Joanna Seybert, Judge) denied Knight's motion and submitted the issue to the jury, which found that Knight was not an employee. On appeal, Knight argues that: (1) the district court erred in submitting the question of whether he was an employee to the jury; (2) the district court erroneously instructed the jury on how to determine whether he was an employee; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's conclusion that he was not an employee; and (4) the district court made several other errors unrelated to the question of whether Knight was an employee.
We reject these arguments and AFFIRM the judgment.

Before: WINTER, LYNCH, and DRONEY, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM.
Plaintiff Anthony Knight, an African-American electrician, sued Defendant State University of New York at Stony Brook (""Stony Brook"") for discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., when it terminated Knight's employment after he reported racist graffiti in a bathroom located at his worksite. At trial, the parties disputed (among other issues) whether Knight qualified as an employee for purposes of Title VII, and the jury was presented with conflicting evidence on that issue. At the close of evidence, Knight moved for judgment as a matter of law that he was Stony Brook's employee. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Joanna Seybert, Judge) denied Knight's motion and submitted the issue to the jury, which found that Knight was not an employee. On appeal, Knight argues that: (1) the district court should not have submitted the question of whether he was an employee to the jury; (2) the district court misinstructed the jury on how to determine whether he was an employee; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's conclusion that he was not an employee; and (4) the district court made several other errors unrelated to the question of whether Knight was an employee. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.
BACKGROUND
At all relevant times, Knight, who is African American, was an electrician and a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 25 (""the Union""). The Union had an arrangement with Stony Brook under which it referred union electricians to Stony Brook when additional workers were needed to supplement its workforce during large construction projects.
Pursuant to this arrangement, the Union referred Knight to Stony Brook, and in April 2011, he began working on a construction project for a psychiatric emergency facility. Sometime that summer or fall,[1] Knight discovered racist graffiti in the bathroom he used at work every morning. He reported the graffiti to the project's foreman, Thomas Murphy, who was also a member of the Union, and to the shop steward, James Malley.[2] His work was terminated sometime thereafter.[3] Knight had worked on the project for approximately six months. Knight then initiated this action against Stony Brook, claiming that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his race and retaliated against for reporting the graffiti in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.
Stony Brook moved to dismiss both claims for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion without prejudice, and Knight submitted a first amended complaint. Stony Brook again moved to dismiss, and the district court dismissed the discrimination claim with prejudice, but declined to dismiss the retaliation claim.
The retaliation claim proceeded to a jury trial. At trial, Stony Brook argued that Knight was not its employee, and that it therefore could not be held liable under Title VII. As the district court recognized, whether a plaintiff is an employee of a defendant for purposes of Title VII is determined by what are known as the Reid factors. See Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 751-52 (1989). Borrowing from the common law of agency, the Reid Court established a non-exhaustive list of thirteen factors which guide the determination of employee status. Id. Those factors are:
the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished[;] . . . the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party.
Id. (footnotes omitted).
The parties presented conflicting evidence regarding several of these factors. Knight elicited testimony that Stony Brook provided some tools for him and the other electricians, tending to show that he was an employee; however, this testimony also revealed that the electricians were required to supply their own basic tools, tending to show the opposite. Knight also presented evidence that Stony Brook controlled the manner and means by which the work was accomplished because Knight received specific assignments every morning, and had no discretion over how or when the work was accomplished; Stony Brook countered by arguing that Knight and the other union electricians had significant control over their work because they were given only an overview of the work that needed to be done, and were then instructed to handle the details of the work on their own. Similarly, when Knight argued that he was an employee because Stony Brook provided him with benefits, Stony Brook produced evidence that the benefits were in fact paid to the union, which was charged with dispersing the benefits to individual members.
Moreover, the factors as to which the facts were not disputed did not clearly favor one party or the other. For example, Knight presented uncontradicted evidence that he was paid by the State Comptroller and was treated as an employee for tax purposes, and Stony Brook, in turn, presented undisputed evidence that the construction work for which Knight was hired was not its usual business, and that the duration of the employment was brief. In sum, several of the factors were disputed, with evidence presented on both sides, and the rest of the factors did not trend decisively in favor of either party.
At the close of evidence, Knight moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law that he was Stony Brook's employee. The district court denied Knight's motion and submitted the issue to the jury, finding that ""the variety of evidence"" created questions of fact that needed to be determined by a jury. App. at 130. It instructed the jury to consider and balance the Reid factors in determining Knight's employment status. After brief deliberations, the jury returned a verdict finding that Knight was not an employee of Stony Brook. Because that finding resolved the case in Stony Brook's favor, the jury did not make any determination about the other elements of Knight's retaliation claim.
Knight did not renew his Rule 50 motion after the verdict under Rule 50(b), or seek a new trial. Instead, he filed this appeal, raising the claims of error set forth above.
DISCUSSION
I. Permitting the Jury to Determine Whether Knight was an Employee
First, Knight contends that a judge, not a jury, should decide whether an individual is an employee, and that the district court therefore erred when it submitted that question to the jury. Whether a jury may determine a plaintiff's status as an employee presents a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. Waggoner v. Barclays PLC, 875 F.3d 79, 97 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Roach v. T.L. Cannon Corp., 778 F.3d 401, 405 (2d Cir. 2015)) (""[W]e review the district court's construction of legal standards de novo""); see also U.S. v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 142 (2d Cir. 1998) (""Whether jury instructions were properly given is a question of law that this court reviews de novo"").
We rejected an argument virtually identical to Knight's in Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 1998). In that case a plaintiff sought a new trial on his state labor law claim on the ground that ""the question of whether he was an employee was improperly submitted to the jury."" Id. at 170. Like Knight, he argued that the question was a legal one that only a court could decide after the jury had made relevant factual findings. Id. Without deciding whether determining employment status presents a question of fact or law, we concluded that ""the submission of that question to the jury"" did not warrant a new trial. Id. at 171. We noted that a district court always has discretion to call for a general verdict.[4] Accordingly, we reasoned that the plaintiff had not suffered any harm to his substantial rights from the trial court's submission of the ""employee"" issue to the jury on general instructions rather than having the jury decide only the narrow factual questions and reserving the bottom-line determination of the issue to itself as a question of law. Because errors that do not affect substantial rights are not grounds for reversal, 28 U.S.C. § 2111, reversal was not warranted.
Kirsch controls here. Although, as Knight notes, we have stated that the district court's ""ultimate determination as to whether a worker is an employee . .. is a question of law,"" Eisenberg v. Advance Relocation & Storage, Inc., 237 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), Kirsch rejected the argument that submitting the question to a jury is prejudicial error, the same contention Knight now makes. In so doing, Kirsch noted that whether an individual is an employee is ""regularly presented to juries that are instructed to return general verdicts, informed by the court's instructions on the law and given the direction that if they find that the plaintiffs in question were employees. . . they should simply state that they find in favor of the plaintiffs."" Kirsch, 148 F.3d at 171.[5] Whether the jury is asked a simple question about liability or a series of questions, the first of which concerns whether the plaintiff was an employee, the effect is the same.
As we held in Kirsch, a trial court does not commit error by submitting the question of whether the plaintiff was the defendant's employee to the jury, whether by general verdict or by special question. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's action.
II. Instructing the Jury on the Reid Factors
Second, Knight asserts that the district court should not have instructed the jury on the Reid factors because those factors are only intended to distinguish employees from independent contractors, and Stony Brook did not contend that Knight was an independent contractor. The correctness of the jury instructions presents a question of law that we review de novo. U.S. v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 142 (2d Cir. 1998) (""Whether jury instructions were properly given is a question of law that this court reviews de novo"").
When the Supreme Court articulated the Reid factors, it stated that where Congress uses the term ""employee"" without meaningfully defining it, ""Congress intended to describe the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by common-law agency doctrine."" Reid, 490 U.S. at 740. The Court then reduced that doctrine to thirteen non-exclusive factors. Id. at 751-52. We have since determined that those Reid factors, subject to a slight alteration, see O'Connor v. Davis, 126 F.3d 112, 115-16 (2d Cir. 1997) (imposing antecedent requirement that individual receive remuneration), constitute the proper test under which to analyze whether an individual is an employee for purposes of Title VII, see, e.g., Salamon v. Our Lady of Victory Hosp., 514 F.3d 217, 226-27 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 321-24 (1992) (applying Reid factors to statutory scheme containing similarly circular definition of employee as Title VII). Although the Reid test may distinguish employees from independent contractors, see Reid, 490 U.S. at 751, that is not its only function. Rather, the Reid factors are the method of analysis Congress intended to require for determining employee status generally under Title VII.
Tellingly, while arguing that the Reid factors apply only for distinguishing employees from independent contractors, Knight offers no alternate test that should be used to determine employee status in other contexts, except to note that in some cases, an employee of one entity may be deemed an employee of another entity under the ""joint employer"" theory. See Arculeo v. On-Site Sales & Mktg., LLC, 425 F.3d 193, 198 (2d Cir. 2005). However, that theory looks to the relationship between two possible employers when ""an employee"" is ""formally employed by one entity,"" and seeks to impose liability on another. Id. It therefore does not help to answer the antecedent question at issue here, of whether an individual is an employee of a single individual or entity. Thus, the ""joint employer"" inquiry cannot replace the Reid factors.
We therefore reject Knight's contention that the district court erred when it instructed the jury to use the Reid factors to determine whether he was Stony Brook's employee.[6]
III. The Application of the Reid Factors
Third, Knight argues that even if the Reid factors apply, they compel the conclusion that he was Stony Brook's employee and that the district court therefore erred in denying his Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. [Blue 18] Stony Brook responds that Knight is precluded from making such an argument because he failed to file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure following the jury's verdict. We agree.
In Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., the Supreme Court determined that a party's failure to make a renewed, post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) ""forecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence"" on appeal. 546 U.S. 394, 404 (2006). Here, Knight failed to file a motion under Rule 50(b), or for that matter make any motion challenging the jury's conclusion that he was not an employee of Stony Brook. He nevertheless argues that the evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to determine that he was not a Stony Brook employee and that the district ""court should have held as a matter of law that [he] was employed by Stony Brook."" Appellant's Br. at 21. That argument is barred by Unitherm. Indeed, in his reply brief, Knight appears to abandon his sufficiency of the evidence challenge. In any event, the argument is without merit. The evidence in the case presented disputed issues of fact regarding several of the Reid factors, and the balancing of those factors and others that pointed both in favor of and against employee status also presented a disputed issue requiring resolution by the fact-finder.
IV. Knight's Evidentiary & Instructional Challenges
Finally, Knight challenges several of the district court's evidentiary rulings, as well as several of its other instructions to the jury. All of those challenges, however, address issues that the jury was instructed not to decide unless it first determined that Knight was Stony Brook's employee. See LNC Invs., Inc. v. Nat'l Westminster Bank, N.J., 308 F.3d 169, 177 n.10 (2d Cir. 2002) (noting that we presume that juries follow district court's instructions). Because we identify no error that requires reversal of the jury's finding that he was not an employee, we need not reach those challenges.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.
[1]  Testimony from different witnesses placed his discovery in either August 2011 or October 2011.
[2]  The parties presented conflicting evidence regarding Murphy's and Malley's reactions to Knight's report. Knight testified that they were indifferent to his complaint, but Murphy and Malley testified that they acted immediately to paint over the graffiti. Because the jury decided the case against Knight on other grounds, it did not have occasion to resolve this dispute.
[3]  The parties also disputed the timing of Knight's termination by Stony Brook. While Knight contends that he was laid off about a week after he reported the racist graffiti, Malley testified that Knight's job ended a full two months after the report.
[4] See Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a) (""The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict. . . ."" (emphasis added)); see also Skidmore v. Balt. & O.R. Co., 167 F.2d 54, 67 (2d Cir. 1948) (""[W]e cannot hold that a district judge errs when, as here, for any reason or no reason whatever, he refuses to demand a special verdict. . . ."").
[5]  Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that a jury may decide the employer/employee issue in Federal Employers' Liability Act cases. Baker v. Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co., 359 U.S. 227, 228 (1959) (concluding in Federal Employers' Liability Act case that although whether an individual is an employee is a question of law, it ""contains factual elements such as to make it one for the jury under appropriate instructions as to the various relevant factors under [the] law""); see also Restatement (Second) of Agency § 220, cmt. c (Am. Law Inst. 1958) (""If the inference is clear that there is, or is not, a master and servant relation, [the determination] is made by the court; otherwise the jury determines the question after instruction by the court as to the matters of fact to be considered."").
[6]  To the extent Knight argues that Stony Brook has not established that he was an independent contractor, we note that it is not necessary for the defendant to establish that any particular label applies to a plaintiff's relationship to an alleged employer. It is rather the plaintiff's burden to establish to the satisfaction of the fact-finder that he is an employee within the meaning of the statute. If he does not, it does not matter how his status might be characterized.

BACKGROUND
We assume that the facts alleged in the underlying complaint are true. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009); Transfield ER Cape Ltd. v. Indus. Carriers, Inc., 571 F.3d 221, 222 (2d Cir. 2009) (recognizing ""[b]ecause maritime attachments are granted on the pleadings, we assume all allegations in the complaint to be true"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). On or about November 2, 2009, DS-Rendite chartered the M/T Ashna to Energy Transportation International Limited (""ETIL"") pursuant to a Time Charter (""Charter""). That same day, Essar Shipping Limited (""ESL"") entered into a novation agreement assuming the obligations of ETIL in the event ETIL defaulted on the Charter. Approximately five years later, Essar Shipping and Logistics Limited (""ESLL"")[2] guaranteed the obligations of ETIL and ESL arising under the Charter. ESLL also agreed to guarantee subsequent settlement agreements between DS-Rendite, ETIL, and ESL resulting from ETIL and ESL's alleged failure to pay the charter-hire costs due under the Charter. DS-Rendite then made ""repeated demand[s]"" for payment. App'x at 12.
Appellant's complaint asserted a claim for breach of a maritime contract against appellees ETIL, ESL, and ESLL and simultaneously sought a maritime attachment and garnishment order against Essar Capital Americas Inc., Essar Capital LLC, Essar Group LLC, Essar Minerals, Inc., Essar Steel Algoma Inc., and Essar Trading Inc. (collectively ""Garnishees"") in the amount of $10,586,346.63. On September 8, 2015, the district court denied the motion for attachment. After the district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration, this appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
This is a classic quasi in rem proceeding. The plaintiff is seeking to assert a claim against a defendant, over whom the court does not (otherwise) have personal jurisdiction, by seizing property of the defendant (alleged here to be in the hands of a third party). Although Rule B states that it applies to ""an in personam action,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. Supp. R. B(1), a maritime in personam claim is more appropriately styled a quasi in rem action. ""[T]he nature of the jurisdiction the court acquires by a Rule B attachment is properly denominated `quasi in rem' because any judgment rendered is limited to the value of the attached property."" Teyseer Cement Co. v. Halla Mar. Corp., 794 F.2d 472, 477 (9th Cir. 1986); see Maryland Tuna Corp. v. MS Benares, 429 F.2d 307, 311 (2d Cir. 1970) (action brought under Rule B is quasi in rem); Eng'g Equip. Co. v. S.S. Selene, 446 F. Supp. 706, 709 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (same). In fact, Rule E, which governs quasi in rem actions, ""applies to actions in personam with process of maritime attachment and garnishment."" Fed. R. Civ. P. Supp. R. E(1); see Peter Friedenberg, The Use of Maritime Attachment as a Jurisdictional Device, 12 Cornell Int'l L.J. 329, 332 (1979) (""It should be emphasized that, despite the language in Rule B limiting its scope to claims brought in personam, the Rule is in fact a classic example of quasi in rem jurisdiction."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The concept of quasi in rem jurisdiction evolved in the Lord Mayor's Court in London and ""served the useful purpose of mitigating the rigors of securing personal jurisdiction"" over elusive defendants. Paul D. Carrington, The Modern Utility of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 303, 304-05 (1962). In a quasi in rem proceeding, ""a thing owned by a specified person is seized as a basis for exercising jurisdiction to decide a claim against the owner."" Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 6 cmt. a (1982).
The quasi in rem device has proved particularly useful in admiralty, where defendants are so often transitory that the ""process of foreign attachment is known of old in admiralty."" Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombiana Del Caribe, S.A., 339 U.S. 684, 693 (1950). Without the use of maritime attachment to provide jurisdiction over defendants' properties, many plaintiffs would not be compensated for meritorious claims, see id. (citing Manro v. Almeida, 23 U.S. 473, 489 (1825)), and international commerce would be diminished. The quasi in rem device, in modern form, is now provided by Rule B.
In a Rule B proceeding, ""the res is the only means by which a court can obtain jurisdiction over the defendant."" Shipping Corp. of India v. Jaldhi Overseas Pte Ltd., 585 F.3d 58, 69 (2d Cir. 2009). So, ""[o]nce that property or its substitute security is released, the court has no jurisdiction over the defendant."" Teyseer, 794 F.2d at 477; cf. The Rock Island Bridge, 73 U.S. 213, 215 (1867) (""The lien and the proceeding in rem are, therefore, correlative — where one exists, the other can be taken, and not otherwise.""); see generally Gilmore & Black, The Law of Admiralty 622 (2d ed. 1975). If a plaintiff is not able to successfully attach the defendant's property under Rule B, the district court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant. Indeed, if the defendant is subject to typical in personam jurisdiction, Rule B cannot be used. STX Panocean (UK) Co. v. Glory Wealth Shipping Pte Ltd., 560 F.3d 127, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2009). At stake in this appeal, therefore, is not only the availability of property to satisfy any judgment that might be entered but also jurisdiction over a defendant to adjudicate a judgment.
With regard to the standard of review, existing case law in this circuit relates only to removal of Rule B attachments. See India S.S. Co. v. Kobil Petroleum Ltd., 663 F.3d 118, 121 (2d Cir. 2011); Jaldhi, 585 F.3d at 66. That established standard is that removal is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. We see no reason why this standard should not apply to the grant or denial of Rule B attachments as well. Of course, findings of adjudicative facts found in a Rule E hearing are reviewed for clear error, while conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Allied. Mar., Inc. v. Descatrade SA, 620 F.3d 70, 74 (2d Cir. 2010); see Man Ferrostaal, Inc. v. M/V Akili, 704 F.3d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 2012). However, where the ultimate judgment involves the weighing and balancing of several factual and legal issues — for example, the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief — the standard of review is abuse of discretion. See SG Cowen Sec. Corp. v. Messih, 224 F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2000). Granting of a Rule B attachment, as discussed infra, whether on the pleadings or after a Rule E hearing requires such weighing and balancing.
To secure an ex parte order of attachment under Rule B, a plaintiff ""bears the burden of establishing a right to attachment."" Jensen v. Rollinger, No. 13 Civ. 1095 (DAE), 2014 WL 4539660, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 11, 2014). The Rule requires the following showing. First, a plaintiff must file a ""verified complaint praying for attachment"" and ""an affidavit stating that, to the affiant's knowledge, or on information and belief, the defendant cannot be found within the district."" Fed. R. Civ. P. Supp. R. B(1)(a) and (b). Second, the complaint ""may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant's tangible or intangible personal property — up to the amount sued for — in the hands of garnishees named in the process."" Id. at Supp. R. B(1)(a). Finally, the district court must then ""review the complaint and affidavit and, if the conditions of . . . Rule B appear to exist, enter an order so stating and authorizing process of attachment and garnishment."" Id. at Supp. R. B(1)(b). If an attachment is ordered, ""any person claiming an interest in [the attached property] shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted."" Id. at Supp. R. E(4)(f) (""Rule E hearing"").
The issue in the present matter is whether appellant's complaint and affidavit make legally sufficient allegations that identifiable property of the defendants, tangible or intangible, is ""in the hands of garnishees."" Id. at Supp. R. B(1)(a). We conclude that the allegations are not sufficient.
As a general matter, the pleading requirements under Rule B are said to be easily met. See Aqua Stoli Shipping Ltd. v. Gardner Smith Pty Ltd., 460 F.3d 434, 443 (2d Cir. 2006), overruled on other grounds by Shipping Corp. Of India Ltd. v. Jaldhi Overseas Pte Ltd., 585 F.3d 58 (2d Cir. 2009) (""Maritime parties are peripatetic, and their assets are often transitory . . . [resulting in] a relatively broad maritime attachment rule, under which the attachment is quite easily obtained.""); ContiChem LPG v. Parsons Shipping Co., 229 F.3d 426, 433-34 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding that to meet the Rule B requirements ""little else [other than the affidavit and complaint] is required and there need only be a hearing after the attachment is served"").
However, there are limits to the ease of attachment under Rule B. An existing attachment order is not valid where the attachment and garnishment is ""served before the garnishee comes into possession of the property,"" Reibor Int'l Ltd. v. Cargo Carriers (KACZ-CO.) Ltd., 759 F.2d 262, 263 (2d Cir. 1985) (affirming the vacatur of an attachment order), or where the garnishees do not ""owe[] a debt to the defendant at the time the order is served."" ContiChem, 229 F.3d at 434 (citing Reibor, 759 F.2d at 266) (same).
Courts have also recognized the need for limits to prevent abuse. See Maersk, Inc. v. Neewra, Inc., 443 F. Supp. 2d 519, 527 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)(""The ease with which a prima facie case for attachment can be made . . . creates a real risk of abusive use of the maritime remedy."") (citation, alteration, and internal quotations omitted). As a result, district courts have often initially granted attachment and then used Rule E hearings to determine whether the requirements of Rule B were in fact met. See, e.g., Transportes Navieros y Terrestres S.A. de C.V. v. Fairmount Heavy Transp., N.V., 572 F.3d 96, 100-03 (2d Cir. 2009); Aqua Stoli, 460 F.3d at 438; Tide Line, Inc. v. Eastrade Commodities, Inc., 2007 A.M.C. 252, 260-61 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).
In recent years, moreover, perhaps in response to motions for broad attachments based entirely on conclusory allegations as to the property to be attached, district courts have required a minimal specificity of factual allegations identifying the defendant's property to be attached before issuing Rule B attachments and holding Rule E hearings. See Marco Polo Shipping Co. Pte. v. Supakit Prod. Co., 2009 A.M.C. 639, 641 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); see also Optimum Shipping & Trading S.A. v. Prestige Marine Servs. PTE. Ltd., No. 08 Civ. 9533 (JSR), 2010 WL 3469542, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2010); DBCN v. Enersur S.A., No. 09 Civ. 8359 (RJS), 2009 WL 3254447, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2009); Deval Denizcilik Ve Ticaret A.S. v. Sensy Freeight SRL, No. 09 Civ. 7314 (LAK), 2009 WL 2633661, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2009); Arctic Ocean Int'l, Ltd. v. High Seas Shipping Ltd., 622 F. Supp. 2d 46, 52 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2009); Peninsula Petroleum Ltd. v. New Econ Line PTE Ltd., No. 09 Civ. 1375 (PGG), 2009 WL 702840, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2009) (adopting the ""reasoning and holding of Marco Polo"").
Marco Polo held that a plaintiff seeking to maintain an existing Rule B attachment ""must at least set forth enough facts to render it plausible that the defendant's funds [are] present in the district."" Marco Polo, 2009 A.M.C. at 641. In applying this standard, courts have held that ""[m]ore is required to demonstrate a `plausible' entitlement to a maritime attachment than . . . conclusory allegations."" Peninsula Petroleum, 2009 WL 702840, at *2 (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Specifically, a plaintiff must allege facts showing ""that it is plausible to believe that Defendant's property will be `in the hands of' garnishees in the Southern District of New York at the time the requested writ of attachment is served or during the time that service is effected."" Id. To meet that standard some identification of the ""property"" is needed.
Neither Rule B nor Rule E provide pleading standards regarding the identification of the property to be attached and garnished. Each rule seems to assume that at least the nature of the property is known. We agree with the application of Twombly standards to the identification of the property to be attached under Rule B. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 (requiring plaintiffs to plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face""). In order to render the garnishee's possession of identifiable property of the defendant plausible, the facts alleged must provide sufficient specificity either as to the nature of the business relationship between the garnishee(s) and the defendant and/or the nature of the defendant's property subject to the attachment.
The present complaint fails to meet that standard. It alleges only in entirely conclusory fashion that the alleged garnishees do business with the defendants. The complaint alleges that ""[e]ach of the Garnishees, on information and belief, holds property of Essar,"" namely ""funds held by . . . Garnishee[s] which are due and owing to Defendants."" App'x at 11, 13. The district court denied the motion for attachment, finding that these entirely conclusory allegations ""d[id] not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that there are attachable assets in this District."" Id. at 22.
When DS-Rendite moved for reconsideration, its brief in support of the motion contained new factual allegations.[3] The brief stated that ""Essar Group,"" an entity nowhere mentioned in the complaint, ""is an indisputably large multinational corporation with thousands of affiliates and subsidies."" Id. at 28. ""Furthermore,"" appellant contended, ""given that Defendants are subsidiaries or affiliates of Essar Group, and the Garnishees are also subsidiaries or affiliates of Essar Group, it is highly likely that the Garnishees owe money to Defendants, and thus have attachable assets within this District."" Id.[4] The district court found that these assertions also failed to ""sufficiently allege[] that Defendants are entitled to a debt owed by the Garnishees."" Id. at 35.
We agree. The complaint's caption lists six companies as garnishees but nowhere alleges facts about the commercial ventures of the garnishees or their business relationships, much less transactions with the three companies named as defendants. Id. at 10. Instead, the complaint states only in conclusory terms that ""[e]ach of the Garnishees, on information and belief, holds property of Essar,"" but does not allege facts explaining why any one of those six companies would hold property of ""Essar,"" which is actually three separate companies. Id. at 11.
Even assuming arguendo that, as a general matter, the defendants and garnishees are somehow ""affiliates or subsidiaries"" of the same ""group"" — an allegation, as noted supra, absent from appellant's complaint — it does not follow that there is a specific entitlement of one of the defendants to a debt owed by a garnishee, see Alaska Reefer Mgmt. LLC v. Network Shipping Ltd., 68 F. Supp. 3d 383, 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), much less a debt that would be in the possession of the garnishee ""at the time the order is served,"" ContiChem, 229 F.3d at 434. As the district courts found in DBCN and Deval Denizcilik, entitlement to an attachment must be based on more than ""a conclusory allegation that, on the basis of general industry practices, it is anticipated and expected that Defendants will have property in this District [in the possession] of . . . garnishees during the pendency of the requested order."" DBCN, 2009 WL 3254447, at *2 (quotation marks omitted); see Deval Denizcilik, 2009 WL 2633661, at *2.
In Marco Polo, the Southern District likewise rejected the contention that ""any likelihood short of impossibility that the defendant's funds could be restrained in the future is sufficient to meet the requirement that the defendant's property be found within the district."" 2009 A.M.C. at 641. In that regard, we note that DS-Rendite fails to allege facts that defendants have ever transferred funds through New York — from garnishees or otherwise. See Peninsula Petroleum, 2009 WL 702840, at *2 (citing cases in this circuit in which plaintiff's allegations met the plausibility standard).
While the availability of a swift Rule E hearing may, in a district court's discretion, allow room for a relaxed pleading standard with regard to an attachment, the pleading must provide targeted guidance as to the property that is the subject of the hearing. As appellant's district court brief in support of the motion for reconsideration made clear by presenting new factual allegations not pleaded in the complaint, see Note 4, supra, a Rule E hearing in this matter would have no focus and be little more than a prolonged fishing expedition.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, it was within the district court's discretion to deny appellant's motion for an order of maritime attachment and garnishment. Should appellant wish to renew its application, appellant may file a complaint and motion according to the standards set forth in this opinion. We affirm.
[1]  Appellees have not entered an appearance in this case.
[2]  Appellant's complaint refers to ""ESSL"" as guaranteeing ETIL and ESL's obligations, App'x at 12, but we assume that it means ""ESLL.""
[3]  For the sake of efficiency, we assume the allegations contained only in appellant's briefs and not in their complaint are properly before us. They are not. See Puglisi v. United States, 586 F.3d 209, 217-18 (2d Cir. 2009); Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir. 1998).
[4]  In a footnote, DS-Rendite revealed the paucity of its allegations by stating: ""For instance, Garnishee Essar Steel Algoma, Inc. actively engages in business transactions with Essar Group affiliate, Essar Steel Minnesota LLC,"" another company nowhere mentioned in the complaint, and ""[t]hus, it is more than likely that the similar Essar Group affiliates interact similarly in transacting business with other Essar Group affiliates.""

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Ting Xu, a native and citizen of China, seeks review of an August 18, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a February 12, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Xu's motion to reopen his removal proceedings. In re Ting Xu, No. A 016 087 178 (B.I.A. Aug. 18, 2016), aff'g No. A 016 087 178 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 12, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
In lieu of filing a brief, the Government moves for summary denial of Xu's petition for review. Summary denial is warranted only if a petition is frivolous, Pillay v. INS, 45 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir. 1995), and Xu has filed his merits brief. Accordingly, we treat the Government's motion as a response to that brief, and deny the petition on the merits.
We review the BIA's denial of Xu's motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, and review the BIA's factual findings regarding country conditions under the substantial evidence standard. Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2008).
It is undisputed that Xu's 2014 motion to reopen was untimely because the final administrative decision was issued in 2008. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i)(setting 90-day filing period for motions to reopen); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1) (same). Although this time limitation does not apply if the motion is filed to apply for asylum ""based on changed country conditions"" since the time of the original hearing, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i), as discussed below, the BIA's conclusion that Xu failed to establish such a change is supported by substantial evidence, see Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 169.
The BIA reasonably concluded that Xu did not establish a material change in conditions in China. Xu's conversion to Christianity in 2012 was a change in his personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions that could excuse the time limitation on his motion to reopen. See Wei Guang Wang v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, 437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir. 2006). His new evidence discussed isolated incidents of persecution in China, which do not equate to a change in conditions, particularly given that the evidence showed similar conditions at the time of his hearing. In re S----Y----G----, 24 I. & N. Dec. 247, 257 (B.I.A. 2007) (""Change that is incremental or incidental does not meet the regulatory requirements for late motions of this type.""). Further, none of the evidence Xu submitted concerned his home province of Jilin. See Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 158-59, 163-65 (explaining that where policies vary by region, a movant has the burden of showing conditions in his home province).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

Laurence D. Behr, Barth Sullivan Behr, Buffalo, NY, for Defendants-Counter-Claimants-Appellees.
Before: NEWMAN and CABRANES, Circuit Judges, and CHATIGNY,[1] District Judge.
JON O. NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.
In this insurance coverage dispute, Citizens Insurance Company of America (""Citizens"") appeals from the Nov. 23, 2016, judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Brenda K. Sannes, District Judge). The judgment declared that Citizens is obligated to defend and, if necessary, indemnify Risen Foods, LLC (""Risen"") and Petr A. Tkach under a businessowners policy and an umbrella policy, both issued by Citizens, in an underlying suit brought by Jason J. Tanner and Cristina Tanner for damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident.
Because we conclude that Risen's vehicle was not covered by either policy, we reverse.
Background
On April 29, 2013, a van owned by Risen and driven by Tkach, a Risen employee, collided with a truck driven by Tanner. Tanner suffered serious injuries. Later in 2013, Tanner and his wife, Cristina, sued Risen and Tkach for Tanner's injuries and related loss of services (""underlying suit"").
The Risen vehicle was insured under a commercial auto policy issued by State Farm Insurance Company (""State Farm"") with a liability limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence. State Farm has provided defense and indemnity coverage to Risen and Tkach with respect to the underlying suit and offered close to the policy limit to settle it.
Citizens issued to Risen a businessowners policy and an umbrella policy. Both policies bear the same policy number, OBF-9828714-00, and the SCHEDULE OF UNDERLYING POLICIES of the umbrella policy states, ""This schedule is part of Policy Number: OBF-9828714-00."" The businessowners policy has a limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence, and the umbrella policy has a limit of $2,000,000 per occurrence.
The policy provisions. The businessowners policy in section II(A)(1), titled ""Business Liability,"" provides:
""We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of `bodily injury', `property damage' or `personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.""
The businessowners policy in section II(B), titled ""Exclusions,"" provides:
""This insurance does not apply to
. . .
""g. Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft
""`Bodily injury' or `property damage' arising out of the ownership . . . of any . . . `auto' . . . owned . . . by . . . any insured.""
The businessowners policy contains an endorsement captioned ""HIRED AUTO AND NON-OWNED AUTO LIABILITY — NEW YORK"" (""the endorsement""), which states, ""This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following: BUSINESSOWNERS POLICY."" Under the heading titled ""Coverage,"" the endorsement provides:
""1. Hired Auto Liability
""The insurance provided under Section II — Liability of the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form, Paragraph A.1. Business Liability, applies to `bodily injury' or `property damage' arising out of the maintenance or use of a `hired auto' by you or your `employees' in the course of your business.
""2. Non-Owned Auto Liability
""The insurance provided under the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form, Paragraph A.1. Business Liability, applies to `bodily injury' or `property damage' arising out of the use of any `non-owned auto' in your business by any person other than you.""
The umbrella policy in section I(A)(1)(a), titled ""Insuring Agreement,"" provides:
""We will pay on behalf of the insured the `ultimate net loss' in excess of the `retained limit' because of `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any `suit' seeking damages for such `bodily injury' or `property damage' when the `underlying insurance' does not provide coverage or the limits of `underlying insurance' have been exhausted. . . . However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any `suit' seeking damages for `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance does not apply.""
The umbrella policy in section V(24), titled ""DEFINITIONS,"" defines ""underlying insurance"" as ""any policies of insurance listed in the Declarations under the Schedule of `underlying insurance'."" The Schedule of Underlying Policies appears as follows:
   CARRIER POLICY NUMBER &            TYPE OF          APPLICABLE LIMITS OR
   PERIOD                             POLICY           AMOUNT OF INSURANCE

   Policy Number:                  Liability           Combined
   Policy Period:                                      $      Each Accident
                                                       Bodily Injury
                                                       $      Each Person
                                                       $      Each Accident
                                                       Property Damage
                                                       $      Each Accident

The schedule explains that the ""X"" preceding ""Non-owned & Hired Autos"" in the second column of the first row (not counting captions) ""indicates these broadening or optional coverages are provided in the Underlying Insurance.""
As the schedule indicates, the first row (item (a)) lists the Citizens businessowners policy, identified by number, as an underlying policy, and the second row (item (b)), where an underlying automobile policy would be expected to be listed, is blank.
The umbrella policy in section I(A)(2), titled ""Exclusions,"" provides:
""This insurance does not apply to:
. . .
""f. Auto Coverages
""(1) `Bodily injury' or `property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any `auto' which is not a `covered auto.'""
The umbrella policy, in section V(5), titled ""DEFINITIONS,"" defines ""covered auto"" to mean ""only those `autos' to which `underlying insurance' applies.""
Communications between insured and insurer. On May 13, 2013, Gerald Pasqualetti, a Risen co-owner, telephoned the Citizens call center to report the April 29 accident and spoke to Nancy Rauscher. In the recorded call, Pasqualetti first explained that ""[o]ur auto insurance and all of that is through State Farm, that's all taken care of."" He then reported that the other driver was in a coma and added, ""[W]e wanted to call you as our general liability carrier just to make sure you are on notice."" He also told Rauscher that the policy number was OBF9828714.
On June 4, 2013, after Citizens employees appeared to have concluded that Risen was claiming coverage only under the umbrella policy, Citizens sent Pasqualetti a letter denying coverage under that policy because the State Farm policy was not listed on the schedule of underlying policies.
After Tanner and his wife filed their lawsuit against Risen and Tkach on December 30, 2013, Risen sent their complaint to Citizens on January 3, 2014. On January 14, 2014, Citizens again notified Pasqualetti that no coverage existed under the umbrella policy.
The pending lawsuit. Citizens filed the pending suit on April 29, 2014, against Risen, Tkach, and the Tanners, seeking a declaration that Citizens had no duty to defend or indemnify Risen or Tkach with respect to the Tanners' lawsuit. On July 4, 2014, the defendants filed an answer and a counterclaim, asserting that Citizens had a duty to defend and indemnify Risen and Tkach under both the businessowners policy and the umbrella policy. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment.
The District Court denied Citizens' motion and granted the defendants' motion. First, the Court ruled that Risen's initial call to Citizens' call center on May 13, 2013, sufficed as notice of a claim under the businessowners policy and triggered Citizens' obligation to ""give written notice as soon as is reasonably possible"" of a ""denial of coverage to the insured and the injured person."" N.Y. Ins. Law § 3420(d)(2).
The Court then ruled that the claim against Citizens with respect to an owned vehicle was outside the coverage of the endorsement to the businessowners policy but within the coverage of that policy itself. The Court understood the endorsement to modify the businessowners policy ""by adding supplemental coverage (for non-owned, hired autos)."" However, the Court stated that ""the auto exclusion remains in full effect,"" and then concluded, ""[W]hile this claim was outside the scope of the endorsement, it was not by reason of the auto exclusion, outside of the scope of coverage provided by the policy.""
By deeming coverage precluded by the auto exclusion, the Court then noted that Citizens was required, under section 3420(d)(2), to give timely notice disclaiming liability ""with respect to the automobile exclusion"" and had failed to do so. The Court rejected Risen's argument that its liability was precluded both by lack of coverage in the policy, which would not require timely notice, and by the automobile exclusion, which would require such notice.
With respect to the umbrella policy, the District Court first rejected Citizens' argument, based on Hasbani v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 98 A.D. 3d 563 (2d Dept. 2012), that this policy did not apply because the State Farm automobile policy was not listed as an underlying policy. The Court explained that the Citizens umbrella policy is broader than the umbrella policy in Hasbani, requiring Citizens to pay because of injury ""to which this insurance applies."" The Court then ruled that the umbrella policy applied to the claim at issue because Risen was a named insured, as was Tkach, an employee of Risen. Finally, acknowledging the auto exclusion of the umbrella policy, the Court ruled that Citizens' disclaimer of liability under the umbrella policy was ineffective to comply with section 3420(d)(2) because the disclaimer relied only on the lack of listing of the State Farm policy as an underlying insurance and did not mention the auto exclusion.
Having ruled that both the businessowners policy and the umbrella policy obligated Citizens to defend and indemnify, the District Court granted summary judgment to the counterclaiming defendants.
Discussion
On the preliminary issue whether Pasqualetti's phone call to Citizens' call center sufficed as the insured's timely notice of the accident, we agree with the District Court that the call gave notice that Risen was seeking coverage under both the businessowners policy and the umbrella policy. Pasqualetti provided the number that Citizens used for both policies. If an insurer wants to make sure that its policy numbers apply only to separate policies, its obvious remedy is to assign different numbers to each policy. Furthermore, Pasqualetti, in the recorded phone call, twice said he was alerting Citizens as our ""general liability carrier.""
However, on the issue whether either the businessowners or the umbrella policies obligate Citizens to defend or indemnify with respect to an accident involving a vehicle owned by Risen, we disagree with the District Court. In our view, the case is squarely governed by our decision in NGM Insurance Co. v. Blakely Pumping, Inc., 593 F.3d 150 (2d Cir. 2010) (""NGM""). NGM, like the pending case, involved a claim under a businessowners policy to which had been added a hired auto and non-owned auto endorsement. The claim was based on an accident involving a vehicle owned by the insured. The District Court in NGM first ruled that the endorsement modified the policy and ""the two must be read together as they constitute the insurance agreement."" NGM Insurance Co. v. Blakely Pumping, Inc., No. 07 CIV 6517-WGY, 2009 WL 765042, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2009) (""NGM Dist. Ct. Op."").
The District Court in NGM then ruled that, because of the definitions of covered autos in the endorsement, ""no coverage is afforded under the Policy and Endorsement"" for the insured's owned vehicle. Id. at *4. Then the Court ruled that the endorsement's exclusion applied, that the insurer had not given the required timely notice of a disclaimer based on the exclusion, and that the insurer could not deny coverage. See id. at *5.
We reversed. Acknowledging that ""[d]etermin[ing] whether there is no coverage by reason of exclusion as opposed to lack of inclusion can be `problematic,'"" NGM, 593 F.3d at 153 (citing Worcester Insurance Co. v. Bettenhauser, 95 N.Y.2d 185, 189 (2000)), we ruled:
""The Endorsement did not generally cover auto accidents; it covered only accidents arising from the use of a `Hired Auto' or `Non-Owned Auto.' Those terms were defined in such a way that an employee's or officer's vehicle, like [the insured's] pick-up truck, could never be covered. . . . In short, there was no coverage by reason of lack of inclusion, and thus no notice of disclaimer was required.""
Id. at 154 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As we noted, ""[N]otice is not required where there is no coverage `by reason of lack of inclusion.'"" Id. at 153 (quoting Zappone v. Home Insurance Co., 55 N.Y.2d 131, 137 (1982)).
The operative language of the endorsement in NGM is identical to the operative language in the endorsement added to the Citizens businessowners policy in the pending case. See Joint Appx. A-234-35, NGM, supra, No. 09-1655-cv; Joint Appx. A-937-38, Citizens Insurance Co. v. Risen Foods, LLC, No. 16-4166-cv. The only differences, set out in the margin,[2] are trivial variations in the labeling of cross-referenced sections of the businessowners policies. The insured defendants in the pending case seek to distinguish NGM on the ground that ""[t]he timeliness of [the] disclaimer was not at issue in NGM."" Br. for Defendants at 35. This is incorrect. As the District Court noted in that case, NGM argued that even if a disclaimer was necessary, ""NGM timely disclaimed the coverage."" NGM Dist. Ct. Op. at *3. In addition, on appeal, Section II of the brief for the insured defendants in NGM was captioned ""NGM INSURANCE COMPANY'S DISCLAIMER OF COVERAGE WAS UNTIMELY,"" and argued the point in detail, see Br. for Defendants at 14, NGM, supra, No. 09-1655-cv. In response, the insurer argued that no timely disclaimer was required because the endorsement's definition of covered autos did not include owned vehicles, see Reply Br. for Plaintiff at 4-9, NGM, supra, No. 09-1655-cv, an argument that this Court accepted in reversing the District Court.
Thus, timeliness of the insurer's disclaimer was put in issue by the insured defendant in NGM, although not resolved by this Court because of the lack of coverage.[3] The insured defendants in the pending case have advanced no valid basis for distinguishing NGM, and that decision, involving an endorsement identical in all material respects to the endorsement in the pending case, requires the same ruling here: timely disclaimer was not required because the policy provided no coverage for an owned vehicle.
In the pending case, the District Court understood Citizens to be arguing that ""the auto exclusion is `a redundant exclusion' and of no consequence."" Memorandum-Decision and Order, Citizens Insurance Co. of America v. Risen Foods, LLC, No. 14-0493, at 21 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2016). The Court rejected what it understood the argument to be, noting that courts must interpret policies in such a way as not to render ""`a portion of [a] provision meaningless.'"" Id. (citing Pichel v. Dryden Mutual Insurance Co., 117 A.D.3d 1267, 1268 (3d Dep't 2014)). But meaninglessness was not quite Citizens' point. The insurer did not argue that the exclusion was meaningless, only that it was redundant because of lack of coverage for owned autos.
It is not surprising that a document, especially one drafted by an insurance company, would use a ""belt and suspenders"" approach, using definitional language to avoid inclusion of coverage and also adding language of exclusion. That was true in NGM and is true here. In both cases, the result of lack of coverage means that timely notice of disclaimer because of exclusion was not required. See Zappone, 55 N.Y.2d at 134.
As to the umbrella policy, it is arguable that it provides no coverage simply because the only listed underlying policy, the businessowners policy, does not provide coverage, and the State Farm policy, which does provide coverage, was not listed.
However, the defendants-counter-claimants contend that because the businessowners policy did not apply (due to an exclusion, of which notice had to be timely), the umbrella policy nevertheless applied as a ""drop down"" policy. They rely on the following language from section I(A)(1)(a): ""We will have the . . . duty to defend the insured against any `suit' seeking damages . . . when the `underlying insurance' does not provide coverage."" But that subparagraph also states: ""However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any `suit' seeking damages for `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance does not apply.""[4] And the umbrella policy's definition of ""[c]overed auto"" is ""only those `autos' to which `underlying insurance' applies."" Because the underlying insurance, the businessowners policy, does not apply to an owned auto, the umbrella policy also does not apply. Referring to the scope of the umbrella policy, the District Court acknowledged that ""the Risen van is not a `covered auto.'""
Conclusion
Because neither the businessowners policy nor the umbrella policy provides coverage, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.
[1]  Judge Robert N. Chatigny, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.
[2]  There are three differences:
1. Section A(1) of the NGM endorsement begins, ""The insurance provided under the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form, Paragraph A.1 Business Liability, applies. . . ."" Section A(1) of the Citizens endorsement inserts the words ""Section II — Liability of"" between ""under"" and ""the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form.""
2. Section B(1) of the NGM endorsement begins, ""The exclusions, under the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form, Paragraph B.1 . . . ."" Paragraph B(1) of the Citizens endorsement inserts the words ""the Section II — Liability of"" between ""under"" and ""the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form.""
3. Section B(2) of the NGM endorsement begins, ""Who is An Insured in the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form . . . ."" Paragraph B(1) of the Citizens endorsement inserts the words ""Section II — Liability of"" between ""under"" and ""the Businessowners Liability Coverage Form.""
[3]  There were two disclaimers in NGM. As our Court reported, ""On March 23, 2006, NGM disclaimed coverage, based on the Policy's exclusion for autos."" NGM, 593 F.3d at 152. We ruled that this disclaimer was timely. See id. at 154 n.2 (""NGM did, in fact, timely disclaim based on the Policy's general auto exclusion.""). Then, after the insured on July 24, 2006, called NGM's attention to the endorsement, NGM two weeks later ""again disclaimed coverage,"" relying on language in the endorsement. See id. at 152. Our Court did not rule on the timeliness of this second disclaimer, deeming the endorsement's language to be a definition that did not include Blakely's vehicle, rather than an exclusion that required a timely disclaimer.
[4]  Similarly, the umbrella policy's payment obligation provides: ""We will pay on behalf of the insured the `ultimate net loss' in excess of the `retained limit' because of `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance applies.""

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Mon Jur Hossain, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, seeks review of a November 10, 2016, decision of the BIA denying Hossain's motion to reopen his removal proceedings. In re Mon Jur Hossain, No. A200 815 894 (B.I.A. Nov. 10, 2016). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.
We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen ""for abuse of discretion."" Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006). We review the BIA's factual findings regarding country conditions under the substantial evidence standard. See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir. 2008). Hossain concedes that his motion to reopen, filed almost two years after the BIA's decision affirming his removal, is untimely under the 90-day deadline for such motions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A)(C)(i).
However, he argues that the time limitation does not apply because he sought reopening to re-apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT"") based on new events in Bangladesh. Specifically, he alleged that the Bangladeshi government (led by the Awami League) filed false charges against him because it perceives him to be affiliated with an Islamist political party (the Jamaat Party). A motion to reopen to apply for asylum is exempt from the time limitation if it is filed to apply for asylum ""based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceedings."" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). In addition to establishing a change in conditions, reopening is warranted only if a movant establishes his ""prima facie eligibility for asylum, i.e., a realistic chance that he will be able to establish eligibility."" Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA did not err in finding that Hossain failed to establish his prima facie eligibility.
To establish eligibility for relief based on future harm, an applicant must show that his fear is objectively reasonable. Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). The BIA reasonably concluded that Hossain did not produce reliable evidence as needed to meet his burden. Hossain offered documents purportedly showing that the Bangladeshi government falsely charged him for participating in riots. The BIA reasonably concluded that the reliability of the documents was undermined by the fact that Hossain was found not credible in the underlying proceedings. See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir. 2007). Hossain argues that his motion was based on a claim independent of the grounds on which he was found not credible. Hossain's reliance on Paul v. Gonzales is misplaced because there the agency had made only a partial adverse credibility ruling. 444 F.3d 148, 150 (2d Cir. 2006). Here, in contrast, the agency did not find Hossain credible in any respect and the underlying adverse credibility determination supports the BIA's refusal to credit documents on a motion to reopen, particularly when, as here, the reliability of those documents rests on the alien's credibility. See Qin Wen Zheng, 500 F.3d at 147.
In addition, the reliability of the documents was further undermined by Hossain's failure to authenticate them by any means and by inconsistencies within the documents. Hossain offered no evidence that the documents actually came from Bangladesh. Although the documents are notarized, Hossain did not explain who obtained the documents, who had the documents notarized, or how he received the documents in the United States. Id. at 149 (upholding BIA decision not to credit document questionable on its face and supported only by family member's affidavit). The documents were also internally inconsistent: some charged Hossain with participating in a riot on November 23, others said November 26, and others contained additional dates that went unexplained. Because Hossain offered no explanation of the documents or how they related to one another, the BIA's inference that documents were contradictory was reasonable. See Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 2007) (""Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. Rather, a reviewing court must defer to that choice so long as the deductions are not illogical or implausible."" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).
Given that the BIA reasonably declined to credit these documents, it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Hossain failed to show his prima facie eligibility for asylum, i.e., that he had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. See Ramsameachire, 357 F.3d at 178; Poradisova, 420 F.3d at 78. This failure to meet the standard for asylum necessarily means he did not show his prima facie eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief. See Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2010).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the order of the district court be AFFIRMED.
Plaintiff-appellant Boonsakdi Boonmalert appeals from an April 12, 2017 order of the district court dismissing his discrimination claims pursuant to a motion under Fed. R. Civ P. 12(b)(6), and denying his cross motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint. On appeal, Boonmalert argues that the district court erred because: (1) it applied the summary judgment standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, instead of the motion to dismiss standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); (2) he pled sufficient facts to support his claims (disparate treatment, retaliation, hostile work environment, Monell, and aiding and abetting); and (3) amending his complaint for a second time would not have been futile. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
1. Certain claims are either time barred, or barred for failure to exhaust. ""A plaintiff seeking to recover under the ADEA must file a discrimination charge with a state agency within 300 days of the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful employment practice."" Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc., 496 F.3d 229, 237 (2d Cir. 2007). Claims brought under the New York State Human Rights Law (""NYSHRL"") and New York City Human Rights Law (""NYCHRL"") ""are time-barred unless filed within three years of the alleged discriminatory acts."" Id. at 238.
Boonmalert alleges, without proof of any filing, that he filed his first EEOC complaint on May 20, 2015. Accordingly any claims accruing prior to July 24, 2014 (300 days before May 20, 2015) are time barred under the ADEA. This includes his September 2012 transfer to a new work unit. Boonmalert argues that any claims predating July 24, 2014 (including his transfer) were part of continuing or ongoing violations, and therefore are not time barred. However, ""[a]s we have stated previously, a completed act such as a discontinuance of a particular job assignment is not of a continuing nature."" Id. at 239. Similarly, a one-time transfer to a new unit is a discrete act, and ""[a] discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act occurred on the day that it happened."" Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Additionally, Boonmalert failed to exhaust certain claims. We have jurisdiction to hear only such claims as ""have been included in an EEOC charge or are based on conduct subsequent to the EEOC charge which is reasonably related to that alleged in the EEOC charge."" Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 381 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Since the June 10, 2015 EEOC complaint only discussed Boonmalert's settlement offer, only alleged adverse actions that are reasonably related to the settlement offer, and that are not time barred, may form the basis of his complaint for our review.
2. As to the disparate treatment claims under the ADEA, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL, Boonmalert argues that he pled sufficient facts to defeat the defendants' motion to dismiss. We disagree.
""We review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting as true all factual claims in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Fink v. Time Warner Cable, 714 F.3d 739, 740-41 (2d Cir. 2013). ""To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id. This standard ""asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully,"" and ""[a] pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Under the ADEA, it is unlawful for an employer to ""discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's age."" 29 U.S.C. § 623 (a)(1). ""A prima facie case of age discrimination requires that plaintiffs demonstrate membership in a protected class, qualification for their position, an adverse employment action, and circumstances that support an inference of age discrimination."" Kassner, 496 F.3d at 238. But at the motion to dismiss stage, an ADEA plaintiff need not plead every element of a prima facie case, only facts which plausibly suggest that (1) the employer took an adverse action and (2) age was the ""but for"" cause of that adverse action. Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 86-87 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 177 (2009)). We have assumed without deciding that ""but for"" causation is also required under the NYSHRL. See Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 105 n.6 (2d Cir. 2010). The issue has not been definitively resolved in the New York courts. See, e.g., DeKenipp v. State, 949 N.Y.S.2d 279, 282 (App. Div. 2012). ""[C]ourts must analyze NYCHRL claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims, construing the NYCHRL's provisions broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible."" Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
Boonmalert failed to plead facts sufficient to allege that he suffered disparate treatment because of his age under the ADEA. ""A plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. To be materially adverse a change in working conditions must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities."" Kassner, 496 F.3d at 238 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Preparing retirement paperwork for Boonmalert during a lengthy absence for medical reasons is not a material change in the terms and conditions of employment. Nor are discussions about retirement, which are a normal part of workplace dialogue between a supervisor and subordinate. See Criley v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 119 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (""[A]n employer's concern about the economic consequences of employment decisions does not constitute age discrimination under the ADEA, even though there may be a correlation with age""). Similarly, the settlement offer is not an adverse employment action; and even if it were, the City made the same offer to Ying, Boonmalert's comparator.
Because NYSHRL claims are treated the same as ADEA claims, the disparate treatment claim under this statute fails as well. This is true even if the 2012 job transfer is deemed an adverse action under the NYSHRL; Ying, who was transferred with Boonmalert, is much younger.
Disparate treatment claims under the NYCHRL are analyzed separately, but even so, there is no such plausible claim. The NYCHRL differs from the ADEA because ""the NYCHRL does not require either materially adverse employment actions or severe and pervasive conduct,"" but instead focuses ""on unequal treatment . . . regardless of whether the conduct is tangible[.]"" Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 114 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). None of the actions that form the basis of Boonmalert's complaint evidence differential treatment based on age.
The district court assumed that Boonmalert's disparate treatment claim under § 1983 was for a violation of his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause, an assumption that Boonmalert did not contest. See Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 320 (2d Cir. 2015) (""Section 1983, through its application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, protects public employees from various forms of discrimination, including hostile work environment and disparate treatment[.]"" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). But Boonmalert abandoned his Equal Protection claim on appeal, and in so doing, abandoned his § 1983 claims as well. Any other claims brought under § 1983 are therefore likewise abandoned.
3. Boonmalert's next claim is that he suffered retaliation in violation of the ADEA, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. Under New York state and federal law, ""[i]n order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show participation in a protected activity known to the defendant; an employment action disadvantaging the plaintiff; and [3] a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action."" Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 156 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The materiality showing required by this standard appears not to be part of a NYCHRL claim. See Williams v. New York City Hous. Auth., 872 N.Y.S.2d 27, 34 n.12 (2009); see also Fincher v. Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 723 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that the ""Appellate Division, First Department, has said that the CHRL `rejects a materiality requirement,' while under Burlington, federal retaliation claims must involve an action by the employer that is `materially adverse.'"" (quoting Williams, 872 N.Y.S.2d at 34 n.12; Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006))). The adverse action cited by Boonmalert is that Ying received a lump sum payment from the settlement; but the settlement offers were substantially the same, and Boonmalert rejected it.
4. Boonmalert's third claim is that he endured a hostile work environment in violation of the ADEA, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. To state a claim for a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must allege that ""the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment."" Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). ""This standard has both objective and subjective components: the conduct complained of must be severe or pervasive enough that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive, and the victim must subjectively perceive the work environment to be abusive."" Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 321 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). To determine whether an incident or series of incidents is ""sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions"" of a plaintiff's work environment, we ""must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance."" Id. at 320-321 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Boonmalert makes no allegation of conduct so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive; and none of the actions he complains of were more than episodic. Discussions of retirement and a one-time preparation of retirement paperwork do not suffice. While under the NYCHRL, the alleged hostile conduct need not be severe or pervasive, see Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 113, Boonmalert must still allege that his age was the motivating factor behind any workplace hostility, and he does not sufficiently do so to survive a motion to dismiss.
5. Under Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), ""[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief"" if an unconstitutional act ""implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers."" Id. at 690. Boonmalert's Monell claim fails for two reasons. First, since he abandoned his equal protection claim on appeal, there is no underlying constitutional violation alleged. Second, Boonmalert does not allege that he suffered any deprivation of rights due to a municipal policy, regulation, or custom. He cites Schwartz's personnel decisions; but under the New York City Charter, the final authority for personnel decisions rests with the Mayor, the City Council, and the City's Personnel Director. So Schwartz's policy decisions cannot form the basis of a Monell claim. See Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 315 (personnel decision of superior who was not a final decision maker was not a Monell violation).
6. Boonmalert's last claim is one for aiding and abetting under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. Since there is no underlying NYSHRL or NYCHRL violation, there was no aiding or abetting of acts forbidden by the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. See Feingold, 366 F.3d at 158. Moreover, Boonmalert alleges that Schwartz alone aided and abetted; but an individual cannot aid and abet their own discriminatory conduct. See Strauss v. N.Y. State Dep't of Educ., 805 N.Y.S.2d 704, 709 (3d Dep't 2005) (""[W]e hold that individuals cannot be held liable under Executive Law § 296(6) for aiding and abetting their own violations of the Human Rights Law."").
7. Finally, Boonmalert argues that he should have been granted leave to file a second amended complaint. ""We review the denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was based on an interpretation of law, in which case the legal conclusion is reviewed de novo."" Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 321 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted). ""Futility is a determination, as a matter of law, that proposed amendments would fail to cure prior deficiencies or to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."" Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Commc'ns, Inc., 681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 2012). ""In assessing whether the proposed complaint states a claim, we consider the proposed amendment[s] . . . along with the remainder of the complaint, accept as true all non-conclusory factual allegations therein, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor to determine whether the allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted, alteration in original).
As the district court determined, any further amendment would be futile. Boonmalert already amended his complaint once after the City's first motion to dismiss, and he alleges no new facts that would cure the pleading deficiencies.
Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Eddy Ruano, a native and citizen of Guatemala, seeks review of a February 3, 2017, decision of the BIA affirming an April 12, 2016, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") ordering Ruano's removal and denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Eddy Ruano, No. A 073 564 952 (B.I.A. Feb. 3, 2017), aff'g No. A 073 564 952 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Apr. 12, 2016). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Ruano entered an Alford plea for the offense of risk of injury to a minor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53-21(a)(1), for which crime he was sentenced to eight years' incarceration. Ruano was charged as removable on the grounds that a conviction under that statute constitutes (1) a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i); and (2) an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A). Each basis is independently sufficient for removal.
Here, the IJ conducted a categorical analysis to conclude that Ruano was removable for a crime of child abuse, but expressly found that the Government had failed to establish that Ruano's conviction constituted an aggravated felony. In affirming the IJ's conclusion that Ruano was removable, the BIA noted Ruano's failure to challenge the crime-of-child abuse determination. [CAR at 3.] To the extent he attempts to do so for the first time on appeal, we decline to entertain that challenge. See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 122 (2d Cir. 2007). Were we to do so, however, we would adopt the IJ's well-reasoned conclusion that Ruano is removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) for a conviction that constitutes a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, but not separately removable as an aggravated felon. See Florez v. Holder, 779 F.3d 207, 211-212 (2d Cir. 2015).
It is not clear whether the BIA deemed Ruano separately removable as an aggravated felon or simply ineligible for withholding of removal on that ground pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b) or for relief under the CAT. The point need not detain us because the government does not urge the first determination, which we, therefore, discard. As to withholding of removal, the IJ and BIA found Ruano ineligible for such relief because his offense constitutes a ""particularly serious crime."" See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). It is argued that the IJ's analysis of the aggravated felony charge with respect to the particularly serious crime bar erroneously placed the burden on Ruano to prove that his actual conduct does not match the federal definition of an aggravated felony. See Martinez v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 113, 121-22 (2d Cir. 2008). However, the IJ also found that ""[a]ssuming arguendo that [Ruano's conviction] is not an aggravated felony . . . the offense remains a particularly serious crime"" based on the nature of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances of the conviction. J. App'x at 51; see also Nethagani v. Mukasey, 532 F.3d 150, 155 (2d Cir. 2008). The record supports this conclusion. Thus, any error respecting an aggravated felony assessment is harmless as ""it is clear that the agency would adhere to its prior decision in the absence of error."" Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir. 2006).
The IJ and BIA found that Ruano had failed to sustain his burden to show that he would suffer persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. The agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence, as the IJ conducted a thorough and reasoned analysis of the country conditions in Guatemala. Cf. id. at 341-42. Thus, even in the absence of a particularly serious crime, Ruano does not qualify for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c), 1208.18(a)(1)-(8).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. In addition, the stay of removal granted by this court's December 1, 2017 order is hereby lifted.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Ali Yalcin, a native and citizen of Turkey, seeks review of a February 29, 2015, decision of the BIA denying his motion to reopen. In re Ali Yalcin, No. A074 856 144 (B.I.A. Feb. 29, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
When an alien, such as Yalcin, petitions for review of the denial of a motion to reopen, we review only the denial of the motion, not the agency's underlying decisions. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 153 (2d Cir. 2006). The BIA ""may deny a motion to reopen based upon the failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought."" Matter of Coelho, 20 I. & N. Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (citations omitted); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988). We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for ""abuse of discretion, mindful that motions to reopen `are disfavored.'"" Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992)). ""An abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the Board's decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner."" Kaur v. BIA, 413 F.3d 232, 233-34 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).
The BIA was within its discretion to find that Yalcin failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for asylum. The IJ's adverse credibility determination was based on several inconsistencies between Yalcin's asylum application, supporting statement, and testimony regarding his affiliation with—or opposition to—a Kurdish political faction and his run-ins with Turkish law enforcement. That finding was dispositive of Yalcin's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006) (explaining that if the same factual assertions supported all claims for relief, an adverse credibility determination necessarily foreclosed relief on all claims). The BIA reasonably concluded that evidence of heightened tensions between the Kurdish faction, the Turkish government, and ISIS ""was not `material' because it did not rebut the adverse credibility finding that provided the basis for the IJ's denial of [Yalcin's] underlying asylum application."" Kaur, 413 F.3d at 234 (citation omitted).
Yalcin argues that the BIA could not rely on an adverse credibility determination that it has never reviewed. The law does not support this argument. See id. (noting that review was limited to the denial of reopening because Kaur failed to timely petition for review of the BIA's decision affirming an IJ's adverse credibility determination).
Yalcin also submits that the BIA failed to acknowledge the statutory exception to the 90-day time limitation for motions to reopen based on changed country conditions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Not so: although the BIA referenced that exception in its decision, the BIA ultimately relied on Yalcin's failure to show prima facie eligibility for asylum as the basis for its decision to deny Yalcin's motion to reopen. The BIA was entitled to do so. Abudu, 485 U.S. at 104.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision is DENIED.
Petitioner Lin Ming Feng (""Lin""), a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of an April 5, 2016 decision of the BIA affirming an October 8, 2014 decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Lin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Lin Ming Feng, No. A205 250 674 (B.I.A. Apr. 5, 2016), aff'g No. A205 250 674 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 8, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
Because the BIA adopted the IJ's reasoning and offered additional commentary, ""we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA."" Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2007). We review the BIA's ""legal conclusions de novo, and its factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard."" Shi Jie Ge v. Holder, 588 F.3d 90, 93-94 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Under the substantial evidence standard, the BIA's factual findings are treated as ""conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary."" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). However, while the substantial evidence standard ""is highly deferential, it does not admit misstatement of the facts in the record or bald speculation or caprice."" Huo Qiang Chen v. Holder, 773 F.3d 396, 403 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).
We turn first to Lin's asylum claim, which requires a showing that he is a ""refugee""—that is, a person outside the country of his or her nationality who is ""unable or unwilling to"" return to that country ""because of persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). Here, Lin claims that he was arrested and beaten by Chinese authorities for practicing Christianity and fled to the United States because he feared ongoing persecution in China and wanted to be able to practice his Christian faith. The IJ concluded, and the BIA agreed, that Lin failed to carry his burden of proof because he was not credible and failed to adduce supporting evidence.
The BIA, drawing on the IJ's analysis, based its adverse credibility findings on three inconsistencies across Lin's credible fear interview, asylum application, and hearing testimony regarding (1) the circumstances of his arrest, (2) the nature of his treatment at the hands of Chinese authorities, and (3) his religious practices in the United States. Although we affirm the adverse credibility finding, the IJ and the BIA's analysis was not without error.
First, in identifying inconsistencies both the IJ and the BIA improperly relied on the notes from Lin's credible fear interview, emphasizing that they made no mention of details—such as the number of Christian churchgoers who were arrested alongside Lin—that were subsequently included in the asylum application and hearing testimony. This Court has observed that ""credible fear interviews are not designed to elicit all the details of an alien's claim, but rather only to determine whether there is `a significant possibility . . . that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.'"" Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 724 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v)). Given the limited purpose of these interviews and their often rushed and tense conditions, the weight IJs and the BIA should ascribe to them depends on how reliable they seem. In Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir. 2004), we articulated four non-exhaustive factors to consider in making this reliability determination: (1) whether the record of the interview is a transcript or merely a summary; (2) whether the questions were designed to ""elicit the details of an asylum claim;"" (3) whether the alien appears to have been ""reluctant to reveal information to [immigration] officials because of prior interrogation sessions or other coercive experiences in his or her home country;"" and (4) whether the alien's statements suggest that he or she did ""not understand English or the translations provided by the interpreter."" 357 F.3d at 180; Zhang, 585 F.3d at 724.
The first three factors call into question the reliability of the recorded statements. First, there is no transcript of the interview but merely shorthand notes that the IJ characterized as ""somewhat sketchy."" R. at 66. This raises questions about whether Lin's statements were fully and accurately memorialized. Second, although the officer asked follow-up questions, none of these questions sought to elicit the details the IJ and the BIA later emphasized, such as how many churchgoers were arrested. Third, assuming the truth of Lin's representation that he was beaten during an interview with Chinese authorities, it is plausible, if not likely, that he was nervous and reserved during his credible fear interview. In light of these limitations, the IJ and BIA gave undue weight to the credible fear interview by relying on the omission of minor factual details.
Second, the IJ and BIA held Lin to an unreasonably stringent standard in finding that his accounts of his treatment at the hands of Chinese authorities were inconsistent. Drawing on the IJ's reasoning, the BIA compared Lin's credible fear interview, where he claimed that he was slapped a few times and his face swelled; his application, where he claimed that he was slapped a few times and his mouth bled and his face swelled; and his testimony, where he claimed that he was slapped four times, handcuffed, and beaten. But these statements are not inconsistent. Although the asylum application mentions bleeding, a detail not included in the credible fear interview notes, this additional fact does not rise to the level of an inconsistency, particularly given the limitations of the credible fear interview. Similarly, when viewed in context, Lin's testimony was consistent with his application. Lin's application said that when the police interrogated him they ""slapped [him] harshly until [his] mouth was bleeding"" and his face became ""swollen."" R. at 176. At the hearing, the interrogation was discussed in greater detail. Lin's attorney asked how the police responded when Lin told them he attended the church gathering to worship, not for political activity. Lin replied, ""They did not believe me and they beat me."" R. at 100. When asked how long the beating lasted, Lin replied, ""They slapped me four times on my face."" R. at 100-01. Counsel then asked, ""Apart from slapping you, did they do anything else?"" and Lin replied, ""They handcuffed me and they beat me."" R. at 101. The IJ and BIA chose to understand this as testimony that Lin was first slapped, then handcuffed, and then the beating continued. But, even if we accept this interpretation, the added fact that Lin's beating continued after he was handcuffed cannot be characterized as an inconsistency. If anything, the IJ has identified a descriptive detail that was omitted from Lin's asylum application, but the ""the impact of omissions must be measured against the whole record before they may justify an adverse credibility determination."" Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., 331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir. 2003), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam). In isolation, this omission indicates nothing more than that narratives vary subtly across retellings.
Notwithstanding these errors, there were other bases for the IJ and BIA's adverse credibility finding. For example, Lin's accounts of his arrest varied. He testified that he was worshipping with eight people, but only he and two others were arrested. By contrast, his application stated that everyone was arrested. When pressed about this inconsistency, Lin confirmed that only three people were arrested but was unable to explain his earlier statement, offering only that he ""[did]n't remember clearly."" R. at 136. The Board declined to credit this explanation. Although such skepticism is by no means necessary, on appeal Lin ""must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). He has failed to make this showing.
Unable to carry his burden based on his own testimony, Lin also failed to present corroborating evidence. The Board emphasized that the record did not contain reasonably available forms of corroboration, such as a letter from Lin's parents—which might have corroborated his claim that Chinese police came to check up on him following his arrest—or the pastor—which might have corroborated the details of the police raid or Lin's religious practices—or any documentary evidence supporting Lin's claim that he attended church in the United States. We have recognized that an IJ may require that an applicant's testimony be corroborated when one would reasonably suspect such evidence to be available at the time of the immigration hearings, and Lin has failed to demonstrate that the evidence requested was not reasonably available to him. Liu v. Holder, 575 F.3d 193, 197-98 (2d Cir. 2009). The adverse credibility finding in conjunction with the absence of corroborating evidence is dispositive of Lin's asylum claim.
Lin's arguments regarding withholding of removal and CAT protection have both been forfeited, the former because it was not properly developed, Tolbert v. Queens Coll., 242 F.3d 58, 75 (2d Cir. 2001), and the latter because it was not raised before the BIA, Zhong v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 121-22 (2d Cir. 2007).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Mei Xiang Weng, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a September 8, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a May 19, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Weng's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Mei Xiang Weng, No. A 205 145 106 (B.I.A. Sept. 8, 2016), aff'g No. A 205 145 106 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 19, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA. Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2008)(per curiam); Yanqin Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir. 2009).
I. Past Persecution
Weng alleged that a police officer chased her out of an underground church gathering and threw a baton at her, hitting her in the back as she fled. The agency was on sound footing in concluding that this single episode did not amount to persecution. See Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding agency's conclusion that ""minor bruising from [a pre-arrest] altercation with family planning officials, which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect,"" did not amount to persecution); Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, 633 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2011) (persecution ""does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
II. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution
Because Weng did not suffer past harm rising to the level of persecution, she had the burden to establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1), (2); Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004); Dong Zhong Zheng v. Mukasey, 552 F.3d 277, 284 (2d Cir. 2009). To meet this standard, an applicant must demonstrate that ""she would be singled out individually for persecution,"" or that there is ""a pattern or practice"" of persecution of persons similarly situated to her. Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 142 (2d Cir. 2008)(citation omitted); see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii).
Weng's evidence that she would be singled out for persecution was based on her claim of past harm. As the agency concluded, Weng failed to meet her burden of proof on this point because her allegation of past harm was not credible. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167.
Weng's submission of her Chinese birth certificate and translations and certificates showing that she both obtained and had the birth certificate translated into English in July 2011 — before she was discovered at the underground church — undermined her allegation that she fled China because of that incident. The document confirming that the English translation conformed to the Chinese version is notarized in China and dated July 2011. Certified Administrative Record (""CAR"") at 213-14. As the IJ found, this discrepancy is significant because Weng claimed that she did not consider leaving China until October 2011, after her encounter with the police. The IJ was not required to credit Weng's explanation—that she was attempting to reregister her Household Register in Fuzhou City in July 2011—because it did not explain the English translation. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although Weng further explained that the translation was done in the United States, that statement is contradicted by the certificate of translation dated July 2011 and notarized in China. CAR at 213 (Chinese version), 214 (English version). Although there is another certificate of translation from an individual in New York, id. at 205, that certificate does not negate the presence of the first. This evidence wholly undermined Weng's claim. See Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. 2007) (reasoning that ""a single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien's uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence"").
The adverse credibility determination is bolstered by Weng's testimony that she was able to travel through and depart China using her own national identification card and passport given her competing testimony that she was a fugitive and authorities were actively seeking her out. See Ying Li v. BCIS, 529 F.3d 79, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2008). Given that the finding was linked to Weng's assertion that she was a fugitive, it was not unduly speculative. See Siewe, 480 F.3d at 168-69 (reasoning that although ""bald"" speculation is an impermissible basis for an adverse credibility finding, ""[t]he speculation that inheres in inference is not `bald' if the inference is made available to the factfinder by record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience"").
The agency reasonably determined that, even crediting Weng's practice of Christianity in the United States, her practice did not provide a basis for relief because she did not establish a pattern or practice of persecution. Weng did not submit evidence of conditions in China. And State Department reports, of which the IJ took administrative notice, reflect that Chinese authorities harass and detain some Christian practitioners, but the reports do not reflect a nationwide pattern or practice of persecution of Christians or any incidents of persecution of Christians in Weng's home province of Fujian. U.S. Dep't of State, Int'l Religious Freedom Report for 2013, at 8-17, available at https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222335.pdf; see also Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 142-43, 149, 169-70 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding no error in the agency's requirement that an applicant demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution specific to her local area when persecutory acts vary according to locality).
As the agency reasonably found that Weng failed to establish the past persecution or objectively reasonable fear of future persecution needed for asylum, it did not err in denying withholding of removal or CAT relief, which carry heavier burdens. See Gomez v. INS, 947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Howard Gayle, a native and citizen of Jamaica, seeks review of the BIA's affirmance of an immigration judge's (""IJ's"") decision ordering him removed to Jamaica. See In re Howard Gayle, No. A045 439 658 (B.I.A. Nov. 4, 2016), aff'g No. A045 439 658 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. May 28, 2015). Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). In so doing, we assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to deny the petition.
On appeal, Gayle challenges the agency's determination that his 1999 conviction for reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of New York Penal Law (""NYPL"") § 120.20 constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude (""CIMT""), rendering him removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). ""We accord Chevron deference to the BIA's construction of ambiguous statutory terms in immigration law, such as `moral turpitude,'"" and ""review de novo the BIA's finding that a petitioner's crime of conviction contains those elements which have been properly found to constitute a CIMT."" Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2007) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In making the latter determination, ""we apply a categorical approach,"" Efstathiadis v. Holder, 752 F.3d 591, 595 (2d Cir. 2014), ""look[ing] to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner's crime,"" Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The BIA has explained that ""[t]o involve moral turpitude, a crime requires two essential elements: reprehensible conduct and a culpable mental state."" Matter of Silva-Trevino, 26 I. & N. Dec. 826, 834 (B.I.A. 2016); see Rodriguez v. Gonzales, 451 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir. 2006). The BIA has further concluded that crimes involving a reckless mental state and aggravated circumstances may constitute CIMTs. See, e.g., Matter of Leal, 26 I. & N. Dec. 20, 25 (B.I.A. 2012) (ruling that ""recklessly exposing another person to a substantial risk of imminent death is morally turpitudinous"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Matter of Wojtkow, 18 I. & N. Dec. 111, 112-13 (B.I.A. 1981) (holding New York manslaughter in the second degree, requiring recklessness, constitutes CIMT); Matter of Medina, 15 I. & N. Dec. 611, 613-14 (B.I.A. 1976) (holding that, although moral turpitude does not inhere in all crimes of recklessness, it inheres in reckless assault with a deadly weapon). We defer to this reasonable interpretation, see Gill v. I.N.S., 420 F.3d 82, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2005) (deferring to BIA's interpretation that crimes committed recklessly in certain aggravated circumstances constitute CIMTs), and proceed to review de novo whether NYPL § 120.20 may be so characterized.
NYPL § 120.20 states that ""[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the second degree when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person."" NYPL § 120.20. Under New York law ""[a] person acts recklessly . . . when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that [a] result will occur or that [a] circumstance exists,"" where such risk is ""of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation."" Id. § 15.05(3). So defined, recklessness is ""a culpable mental state for moral turpitude purposes"" when combined with aggravating circumstances. Matter of Leal, 26 I. & N. Dec. at 23 (stating recklessness amounts to culpable mental state ""where it entails a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk posed by one's conduct""); see also Gill v. I.N.S., 420 F.3d at 89 (recognizing that crimes committed recklessly have amounted to CIMTs ""where recklessness is defined as a conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk"" (emphasis omitted)). Crimes that are the equivalent of a simple assault do not present the aggravating circumstance necessary for a CIMT, but crimes involving more serious physical harm do. See Gill v. I.N.S., 420 F.3d at 89-90; Matter of Leal, 26 I. & N. Dec. at 24-26; Matter of Faulaau, 21 I. & N. Dec. 475, 478 (B.I.A. 1996). We conclude that NYPL § 120.20 requires such aggravated conduct.
A violation of NYPL § 120.20 requires proof that the defendant engaged in conduct risking ""serious physical injury,"" NYPL § 120.20, which New York law defines as ""physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes death or serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ,"" id. § 10.00(10). This danger of death or serious and protracted bodily injury constitutes an aggravating circumstance. See Matter of Leal, 26 I. & N. Dec. at 24-26; Matter of Faulaau, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 478; see also Gill v. I.N.S., 420 F.3d at 89 (concluding reckless assault is CIMT where it involves a deadly instrument and serious bodily harm). Accordingly, on de novo review, we conclude that NYPL § 120.20 requires both recklessness and an aggravated circumstance, such that a conviction under that statute categorically constitutes a CIMT.
In urging otherwise, Gayle argues that New York case law shows that convictions under NYPL § 120.20 do not ""necessarily involve[] conduct that rises to the level of moral turpitude."" Petitioner's Br. at 7. While categorical review indeed focuses on ""whether or not the minimum conduct criminalized by the statute would support classification of a crime as a CIMT,"" Efstathiadis v. Holder, 752 F.3d at 595 (internal quotation marks omitted), and although the agency did not itself review this case law, we independently conclude that Gayle's argument fails because, in each of the cases he cites, the culpable conduct was ""morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong,"" Matter of Franklin, 20 I. & N. Dec. 867, 868 (B.I.A. 1994), and entailed both a reckless mental state and risk of serious physical injury or death to others. See, e.g., People v. Roth, 80 N.Y.2d 239, 245, 590 N.Y.S.3d 30, 32 (1992) (upholding § 120.20 charge where defendants permitted unsafe working conditions in allowing petroleum tank to be cleaned without adequate ventilation near ignition sources, resulting in fatal explosion); People v. Einaugler, 206 A.D.2d 946, 947, 618 N.Y.S.2d 414, 415 (2d Dep't 1994) (affirming § 120.20 conviction where doctor, despite knowing condition could be fatal if untreated, delayed transferring patient to hospital for more than ten hours, resulting in death); People v. King, 141 A.D.2d 563, 565, 529 N.Y.S.2d 172, 174 (2d Dep't 1988) (affirming § 120.20 conviction where police officer opened door of moving car, hitting youth on bicycle and propelling bicycle into pedestrian, and police car then sped away); People v. Canty, 135 A.D.2d 721, 722, 522 N.Y.S.2d 622, 623 (2d Dep't 1987) (affirming § 120.20 conviction where defendant started fire in apartment building by splashing rubbing alcohol and igniting it); People v. Vizzini, 78 Misc. 2d 1040, 1047-48, 359 N.Y.S.2d 143, 151 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1974) (denying motion to dismiss § 120.20 charge where defendants called for strike of New York City firefighters ""for mere personal or pecuniary gain,"" thereby depriving more than eight million people of fire protection and creating risk that could be found ""tantamount to imminent peril""). Moreover, to the extent Gayle purports to rely on the facts underlying his own conviction, he fails to support his characterization of those facts with any record evidence. See Poole v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 259, 263 (2d Cir. 2008) (declining to consider factual assertion in brief unsupported by administrative record).
Gayle further argues that the BIA erred in relying on Matter of Hernandez, 26 I. & N. Dec. 464 (B.I.A. 2015), because that decision was subsequently reversed and remanded by Hernandez v. Lynch, 823 F.3d 279 (5th Cir. 2016). The Fifth Circuit there remanded, however, for the BIA to apply that circuit's standard for categorically determining whether the particular crime constituted a CIMT. Here, the BIA explicitly recognized the Fifth Circuit's remand on such grounds in relying on Matter of Hernandez for the distinct proposition that recklessness coupled with aggravating circumstances such as danger of serious bodily injury can amount to moral turpitude. Moreover, while Gayle argues the agency ""failed to comply with"" its decision in Matter of Silva-Trevino, 26 I. & N. Dec. 826 (B.I.A. 2016), Petitioner's Br. at 14, the BIA in fact explicitly relied upon that decision in analyzing whether the conviction here at issue constitutes a CIMT.
We note, however, that even in relying on Silva-Trevino, the BIA appears not to have followed the approach that case requires. As Silva-Trevino and our circuit precedent recognize, we follow a categorical approach to determine whether an offense is a CIMT. See Matter of Silva-Trevino, 26 I. & N. Dec. at 831-32; Efstathiadis v. Holder, 752 F.3d at 595. The BIA did not explicitly follow the categorical approach when considering Gayle's case. Nevertheless, our review indicates that the categorical approach does not yield a different outcome and that remand in this case would be needless. In the future, however, we expect the BIA's decisions to reflect the use of the categorical approach when appropriate.
Gayle contends, in any event, that NYPL § 120.20 does not require sufficient aggravating circumstances for a CIMT because its language does not specify that the risk of death or serious injury must be ""imminent,"" Petitioner's Br. at 18, unlike the statutes in other cases relied on by the BIA. We agree with the agency's determination, however, that its precedent does not demand that serious bodily injury necessarily be imminent to demonstrate the requisite aggravating circumstance for a CIMT. Rather, the aggravating circumstance that must accompany a defendant's reckless action is actual bodily injury or a substantial risk thereof. The imminence of such injury may be relevant to showing that the risk was substantial, but it is not the only way to make that showing.
Finally, insofar as Gayle faults the agency for not relying on its prior unpublished decision in Matter of McFarlane, 2006 WL 557819 (B.I.A. Feb. 6, 2006) (concluding that NYPL § 120.20 is not a CIMT), we have recognized that ""the BIA . . . accords no precedential value to its own unreported decisions,"" Rotimi v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), and thus the agency did not err in declining to accord such value here.
We have considered Gayle's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Suhang Lin, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a July 27, 2015 decision of the BIA affirming a July 15, 2014 decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Lin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Suhang Lin, No. A087 798 612 (B.I.A. July 27, 2015), aff'g No. A087 798 612 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. July 15, 2014).
Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA, see Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005), and address only the adverse credibility determination, applying well established standards of review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008) (reviewing adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence). In doing so, we assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.
For applications such as Li's, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, ""[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,"" base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant's ""demeanor, candor, or responsiveness,"" the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements and other record evidence ""without regard to whether"" the inconsistencies go ""to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d at 163-64. ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d at 167. Further, ""[a] petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). By these standards, the agency's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.
First, the IJ concluded that Lin's testimony was inconsistent with respect to his contacts with his father. Lin testified that he saw his father once when he first arrived in the United States in 2010, and had not seen him again thereafter. At his 2011 asylum interview, however, Lin indicated that he was at that time living with his father and aunt in Brooklyn; when confronted at his hearing with notes of that interview, Lin admitted that he had made this statement under oath, but continued to assert that he had not seen his father since 2010.[1] The inconsistency was reinforced by the testimony of Lin's aunt, who stated that when Lin's father was in the New York area, he would visit and stay at their home. She further testified that she had seen Lin and his father attend church together, although Lin had testified they had never done so.
The IJ was entitled to discredit Lin's testimony based on his contradictory descriptions of his interactions with his father and the contrary testimony of his aunt. See Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 2007) (""Drawing inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence is a routine and necessary task of any factfinder.""). Although this inconsistency did not go to the core of Lin's claim, it was not ""minor and isolated,"" Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 294 (2d Cir. 2006), but rather a major circumstance of his life and religious observance in the United States, see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d at 167 (""[A]n IJ may rely on any inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the `totality of the circumstances' establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible."" (emphasis in original)).
Second, the IJ's general doubts about Lin's demeanor provide further support for the adverse credibility ruling. ""[T]he IJ has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant,"" and so that finding deserves deference. Zhou Yun Zhang v. U.S. INS, 386 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir. 2004), overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir. 2007). The IJ found that Lin's testimony was generally ""disingenuous"" and that his halting responses were frequently a means of ""buying time to formulate an answer."" A.R. 64. The IJ specifically identified Lin's testimony about his past persecution as ""vague and incredible,"" id. at 65; his testimony about his religious observance not ""genuine,"" id.; and his testimony about his proselytizing activities and baptism neither ""genuine"" nor ""convincing,"" id. at 67-68. The IJ also noted that Lin's testimony about whether he lived with his father was ""confusing[],"" id. at 56, and ""inconsisten[t],"" id. at 66. See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 2006) (""We can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant's demeanor where, as here, they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony."").
Finally, the IJ found that Lin's failure to supply corroborating evidence—such as a letter from the aunt who introduced him to the church in the United States—failed to rehabilitate his discredited religious observance testimony. See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (explaining that ""absence of corroboration"" may make applicant ""unable to rehabilitate testimony that [had] already been called into question""). We identify no error in that finding.
Given the IJ's demeanor finding, the noted testimonial inconsistencies, and the lack of corroboration of his alleged continuing religious practice, the totality of the circumstances supports the IJ's adverse credibility determination such that no reasonable factfinder would be ""compelled to conclude to the contrary."" Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d at 79 (internal quotation marks omitted).[2] Because Lin's asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims were based on the same factual predicate, and the credibility determination was dispositive as to all three, see Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006), and we need not review the agency's time-bar denial of asylum, see INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (""As a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach."").
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.
[1]  Lin argues that the BIA wrongly determined that the IJ relied upon the notes of the interview, which were not part of the record. The IJ's decision, however, makes clear that the credibility judgment in this regard was made ""based on the respondent's own admissions"" that he ""testified previously, under oath, inconsistent"" with his hearing testimony, as well as his inability to explain that inconsistency. A.R. 66.
[2]  Insofar as Lin alleges error in other IJ and BIA adverse credibility findings, we conclude that, even assuming error, remand would be futile given the findings affirmed here. See Lianping Li v. Lynch, 839 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 2016) (stating remand futile if (1) substantial record evidence relied on by IJ, considered in aggregate, supports finding that petitioner lacked credibility, and (2) disregarding aspects of IJ's reasoning that are tainted by error, ""we can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER"").

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Solange Rocha, a native and citizen of Brazil, illegally reentered the United States after being removed in 2009. She seeks review of a May 2, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a March 31, 2914, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Rocha's application for withholding of removal.[1] In re Solange Rocha, No. A200 026 570 (B.I.A. May 2, 2016), aff'g No. A200 026 570 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Mar. 31, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA and assume, as the BIA did, that Rocha identified a cognizable social group. See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the issue is whether Rocha established that she fell within that social group. To succeed on a claim for withholding of removal, the applicant ""must demonstrate that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason"" for persecuting the applicant. Matter of C----T----L----, 25 I. & N. Dec. 341, 348 (BIA 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). ""We review factual findings under the substantial evidence standard,"" while ""[q]uestions of law, as well as the application of legal principles to undisputed facts, are reviewed de novo."" Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d 191, 195 (2d Cir. 2014). The agency did not err in denying relief because, as discussed below, Rocha did not demonstrate that any past harm or feared future harm was or would be on account of her membership in her proposed particular social group.
The agency reasonably found that Rocha failed to establish membership in her proposed social group of women in relationships that they are unable to leave. Rocha was in fact able to leave the relationship—she testified that when she was 21, she moved out of her mother's house and was thereby able to escape her stepfather's abuse. She also had friends who helped her escape a second time when she returned to Brazil, after the abuse resumed when she voluntarily moved back in with her mother and stepfather. In addition, her mother has since thrown her stepfather out of the house, indicating that even if Rocha were to return to Brazil and move back in with her mother, her stepfather would not be there to abuse her.
Rocha argues that the agency should have considered the issue of her ability to relocate separately from the issue of whether she was a member of her proposed particular social group.[2] The analysis Rocha challenges, however, is the agency's evaluation of her ability to leave the relationship, which is itself an element of the particular social group that Rocha proposed: ""Brazilian wom[en] that cannot leave the relationship."" Pet'r Br. 9. Rocha also asserts that the agency erred by considering events ""outside the relevant temporal scope of the inquiry,"" i.e., her leaving home at the age of 21 to live with her boyfriend. Id. at 17. But the agency is required to ""consider all the evidence in the record that has probative value."" Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir. 2005).
Rocha argues that her situation is similar to Matter of A----R----C----G----, which involved an applicant who was eventually able to leave her relationship. 26 I. & N. Dec. 388 (BIA 2014). But the facts in Matter of A----R----C----G---- are distinguishable: the abuser followed his victim when she tried to move out and threatened to kill her if she did not return to him. Id. at 389, 395. Here, although Rocha sometimes saw her stepfather at her boyfriend's house, there is no evidence that he threatened her or tried to force her to return or that she otherwise felt any pressure to return to him; instead, she testified that she returned to her mother's home of her own volition because she thought the situation had changed.
Rocha further argues that the agency failed to consider the years of abuse she suffered before she moved in with her boyfriend in 2000. To the contrary, the agency expressly made findings regarding that abuse and considered it in determining that she may have established harm rising to the level of persecution, although not on account of a protected ground. Moreover, the abuse that she suffered at that time does not take away from the fact that she was able to leave the relationship by moving out of the house, or that her mother has since evicted the stepfather from their home.
Rocha was also required to show that she was harmed by a governmental actor or independent actors whom the government is unwilling or unable to control. See Rizal v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 84, 92 (2d Cir. 2006); Sotelo-Aquije v. Slattery, 17 F.3d 33, 37 (2d Cir. 1994). The agency's finding that Rocha failed to establish that the Brazilian government was unwilling or unable to protect her is supported by substantial evidence. Rocha testified that she never called the police or otherwise reported her abuse to the authorities. Moreover, the 2012 State Department report reflected that the Brazilian government was working to improve resources for victims and that ""police generally enforced the [domestic violence] law effectively."" A 206. Accordingly, the agency did not err in holding that Rocha failed to meet her burden of showing that she was persecuted ""by the government . . . or at the hands of an organization or person from which the government cannot or will not protect [her]."" Aliyev v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42), 1231(b)(3)(A).
The agency also reasonably held that Rocha failed to meet her burden of showing that she could not reasonably relocate in Brazil. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(3)(i). Rocha testified that she had safely relocated twice before, once when she went to live with her boyfriend and once when she stayed with her son's grandmother. She also testified that she was able to work and earn money in the past. The agency's holding that Rocha could reasonably relocate was therefore supported by substantial evidence. Id.; see also Singh v. BIA, 435 F.3d 216, 219 (2d Cir. 2006) (""Asylum in the United States is not available to obviate re-location to sanctuary in one's own country."").
Finally, Rocha argues that the agency erred in not granting her humanitarian asylum. But Rocha is subject to a reinstatement order, meaning that she is only eligible for withholding of removal and cannot qualify for asylum. Herrera-Molina v. Holder, 597 F.3d 128, 139 (2d Cir. 2010); 8 C.F.R. § 241.8(e).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.
[1]  Rocha does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.
[2]  Rocha argues that the agency should have shifted the burden of reasonable relocation to the Government, but Rocha did not establish that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, so the burden did not shift to the Government. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(3)(i).

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT=S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioners Dongmei Tong and Zhaoyue Sun, natives and citizens of the People's Republic of China, seek review of a June 7, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a March 13, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Tong's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT"").[1] Dongmei Tong, Zhaoyue Sun, No. A205 240 661/662 (B.I.A. June 7, 2016), aff'g No. A205 240 661/662 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 13, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as supplemented by the BIA. See Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2007). The standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008).
The agency may, ""[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,"" base an adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies or omissions in an applicant's testimony, application, and other record evidence, regardless of whether any such discrepancies ""go[] to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64, 166-67 & n.2. ""An applicant's failure to corroborate . . . her testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question."" Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007). ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless . . . it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167.
Significant inconsistencies regarding the timeline of Tong's prior marriage and her ex-husband's abuse provide substantial evidence for the adverse credibility determination. See Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 295-96 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that a single material inconsistency relating to central aspect of an asylum claim provided substantial evidence for an adverse credibility determination). For example, Tong's testimony that she first moved out in 2007 conflicted with a divorce certificate showing she and her ex-husband divorced in 2003. And Tong's testimony that she did not see her ex-husband between 2004 and December 2007 conflicted with a letter from Tong's former classmate stating that he saw Tong after an incident of abuse in July 2007.
Tong testified that she was confused and unable to recall the exact dates of events. While it is plausible that severe injuries and trauma from this abuse would affect Tong's ability to recall accurately the timeline of events, the agency reasonably rejected this explanation because Tong did not provide a medical or psychological evaluation to support it. Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Although an asylum application need not include all the details of a claim, see Pavlova v. INS, 441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 2006), Tong's omission of details bolsters the adverse credibility determination, particularly as she omitted a serious incident in which her husband threatened her with a gun, see Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3 (""An inconsistency and an omission are . . . functionally equivalent"" for credibility purposes).
The agency also reasonably concluded that Tong's corroborating evidence did not rehabilitate her credibility. She did not submit evidence to corroborate that her husband was a police officer, arrest records related to the 2010 incident, or medical records for her son to corroborate Tong's testimony that he also suffered abuse. See Biao Yang, 496 F.3d at 273. Tong's challenge to the agency's decision to give her medical records little weight is both unexhausted, Foster v. INS, 376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004) (requiring petitioner to raise issues to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review), and without merit. We generally ""defer to the agency's determination of the weight afforded to an alien's documentary evidence."" Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 334 (2d Cir. 2013). Here, the medical records related only to incidents from 2000 and were not authenticated or certified by the hospital.
Given Tong's inconsistent testimony regarding the timeline during which her abuse occurred, her omission of details concerning her abuse, and given her lack of reliable corroboration, the totality of the circumstances supports the adverse credibility determination. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167; Biao Yang, 496 F.3d at 273; Xian Tuan Ye, 446 F.3d at 295-96. Because Tong's claims were all based on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.
[1]  Sun sought asylum only as Tong's derivative beneficiary, and did not seek withholding of removal or CAT relief in his own right.

The NASDAQ public stock exchange conducted the initial public offering for Facebook, Inc. NASDAQ encountered a variety of technical difficulties in executing the IPO that resulted in trades not being performed properly. Retail investors sued NASDAQ, and those claims were eventually settled for $26.5 million.
NASDAQ maintained both errors and omissions (""E&O"") and directors' and officers' (""D&O"") insurance policies. Appellant Beazley Insurance Company was the second-level E&O carrier; appellees ACE American Insurance Company and Illinois National Insurance Company were the first and second level D&O carriers, respectively. ACE and Illinois National disclaimed coverage under the D&O policies. Beazley paid out its policy limit of $15 million in E&O coverage subject to an agreement with NASDAQ in which NASDAQ assigned Beazley its contractual rights against ACE and National. Beazley then sued ACE and National for coverage under D&O policies.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Rakoff, J.) ultimately granted ACE and Illinois National summary judgment. Beazley Ins. Co. Inc. v. ACE Am. Ins. Co., 197 F. Supp. 3d 616 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The district court found that (1) retail investors in Facebook were unambiguously ""customers"" of NASDAQ; (2) the underlying securities claims against NASDAQ arose out of NASDAQ's provision of professional services; and (3) thus, the claims were excluded from coverage pursuant to the D&O policy's professional services exclusion. We agree with the district court that federal securities law makes clear that retail investors in company stock are ""customers"" of NASDAQ within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue. We also agree that the claims in the underlying complaint arose out of the provision of ""professional services,"" as plaintiffs could not prevail without demonstrating that their losses flowed from NASDAQ's failure to properly process their trades. We thus affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the issue of indemnification.
BACKGROUND
NASDAQ is a public stock exchange that provides an electronic trading platform on which its members, registered broker-dealers, execute securities transactions. See NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. v. UBS Sec. LLC, 770 F.3d 1010, 1013-14 (2d Cir. 2014). Members trade on NASDAQ both on their own behalf, and on behalf of retail investors. See id.
As relevant here, NASDAQ maintained two stacks, or towers, of insurance coverage. NASDAQ purchased a tower of E&O coverage from Chartis Specialty Insurance Company, Beazley and ACE. Chartis provided primary coverage of $15 million, above a $1 million self-insured retention, for all ""[d]amages resulting from any Claim . . . for any Wrongful Act of the Insured"" that ""occur[ed] . . . solely in rendering or failing to render Professional Services."" App'x at 204. The Beazley E&O policy provided excess coverage with another $15 million in coverage, and ""follow[ed] form"" to Chartis' policy, that is, provided coverage on the same terms. App'x at 192. ACE's policy provided second level excess insurance, with a $15 million limit after the Chartis and Beazley policies were exhausted. [App'x 177] Altogether, NASDAQ purchased $50 million in E&O coverage.
NASDAQ also purchased a tower of D&O coverage from ACE and Illinois National. The ACE D&O policy was primary and provided $15 million in coverage after a $2 million self-insurance retention for liability incurred by certain officers and directors for any ""[w]rongful [a]cts."" App'x at 1624. The ACE D&O also provided coverage to NASDAQ for any losses NASDAQ became obligated to pay ""by reason of a Securities Claim . . . for any Wrongful Acts."" App'x at 1624. The ACE D&O policy also contained a ""professional services exclusion"" that provided that ACE ""shall not be liable for Loss on account of any Claim . . . by or on behalf of a customer or client of the Company, alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services."" App'x at 1628, 1653. Illinois National issued an excess policy for an additional $15 million in coverage that follows form with the ACE D&O policy.
NASDAQ carried Facebook's initial public offering on May 18, 2012. It did not go smoothly—NASDAQ's trading platform suffered a series of technical failures, resulting in the improper processing of orders to buy and sell stock. Retail investors in Facebook sued NASDAQ, alleging that they suffered losses as a result of NASDAQ's technical failures. In all, more than 40 lawsuits related to the Facebook IPO were brought against NASDAQ across the country, and were eventually consolidated in the Southern District of New York.
After consolidation, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint (the ""CAC"") against NASDAQ and two NASDAQ officers: Robert Greifeld, then-president and chief executive officer; and Anna Ewing, then-chief information officer (collectively, ""NASDAQ""). The CAC, filed in April 2013, was brought on behalf of a putative class of all persons who entered orders to buy or sell Facebook's common stock on May 18, 2012 and lost money as a result of NASDAQ's alleged wrongdoing. The CAC asserted securities fraud claims pursuant to sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as state law negligence claims.
NASDAQ provided notice of the CAC to each insurer. Chartis accepted potential coverage under its E&O policy subject to a reservation of rights, as did Beazley and ACE. However, both ACE and Illinois National disclaimed coverage under the D&O policies, relying on the ""professional services"" exclusion in the ACE policy. Neither NASDAQ nor its broker challenged the disclaimer. NASDAQ renewed the D&O policy twice without ever raising the issue.
NASDAQ agreed to settle the CAC in April 2015 for $26.5 million, and sought coverage under its E&O tower to pay for both the settlement and NASDAQ's defense costs. Chartis paid out its $15 million, and ACE paid out $4.9 million under its third-level E&O policy. Because Chartis and ACE were responsible for the cost of defending the lawsuits, the claim cost them more than the $26.5 million settlement figure. Beazley also paid out its full $15 million pursuant to an agreement in which NASDAQ ""assign[ed] to Beazley any and all contractual rights or extra-contractual rights they have or that they may acquire . . . against ACE and/or Illinois National in connection with the [CAC] up to the amount of [$15 million]."" App'x at 4101. The agreement also provided that NASDAQ would not take ""any formal position with regard to the availability of coverage under the ACE D&O Policy and/or the [Illinois National policy] for the claims asserted in the"" CAC, and that NASDAQ would ""not voluntarily provide any testimony or declaration in connection with any proceeding between Beazley on the one hand and ACE and/or Illinois National on the other arising out of or related to the"" CAC. App'x at 4128.
Beazley then attempted to get ACE to reconsider its denial of coverage, and when those efforts were unsuccessful, sued for coverage under the D&O policies in June 2015. In July 2015, Beazley moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that ACE had an obligation to provide a defense. The district court granted the motion, noting:
On balance, the Court is in agreement with Beazley that interpreting ""customer [s] or client[s]"" to exclude retail investors in a public company listed on NASDAQ is at least one reasonable interpretation of the ACE D&O Policy. As a consequence, ACE has failed to satisfy its ""heavy burden of demonstrating that . . . the [Professional Services] exclusion is subject to no other reasonable interpretation"" than the one it has proffered to disclaim coverage, and ACE was therefore obligated to provide NASDAQ with defense costs coverage in connection with NASDAQ's defense of the CAC.
Beazley Ins. Co., Inc. v. ACE Am. Ins. Co., 150 F. Supp. 3d 345, 353 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).
However, the district court cabined its holding:
To be clear, the Court is not interpreting ""customer[s] or client[s]"" to exclude retail investors as a matter of law, as that is not the relevant question for purposes of plaintiff's motion. Defendants are free, with the benefit of discovery, to renew their arguments as to the meaning of ""customers or clients"" on summary judgment.
Id. at n.9.
Following discovery, in January 2016 Beazley moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that ACE had a duty to indemnify in connection with the CAC settlement. ACE and Illinois National cross-moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims. The district court denied Beazley's motion, granted ACE and Illinois National's motion and also found ACE liable for unreimbursed attorneys' fees and costs reasonably incurred by NASDAQ in excess of the policy's $2 million retention. This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
""We review orders granting summary judgment de novo."" Hizam v. Kerry, 747 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 2014). The parties are in agreement that New York law applies to their dispute. ACE based its disclaimer on the D&O policy's professional services exclusion, which provides that:
The Insurer shall not be liable for Loss on account of any Claim . . . by or on behalf of a customer or client of the Company [i.e., NASDAQ], alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services.
App'x at 1628, 1653. The D&O policy defines neither ""customer or client"" nor ""professional services."" Beazley argues that the district court erred in enforcing the exclusion because (1) the retail investors who sued and settled the CAC are not customers or clients within the meaning of the D&O policy, and (2) the claims settled in the CAC are not ""alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services."" The burden of proving the exclusion applies rests with the insurer. Pioneer Tower Owners Ass'n v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 12 N.Y.3d 302, 307 (2009).
""The law governing the interpretation of exclusionary clauses in insurance policies is highly favorable to insureds."" Id. at 306 (internal quotation marks omitted). Policy exclusions are enforced only when they ""have a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception . . . and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion."" Id. at 307. Thus:
[W]henever an insurer wishes to exclude certain coverage from its policy obligations, it must do so in clear and unmistakable language. Any such exclusions or exceptions from policy coverage must be specific and clear in order to be enforced. They are not to be extended by interpretation or implication, but are to be accorded a strict and narrow construction.
Id. (citation omitted).
I. Customers and clients
""[A]n insurance contract is interpreted to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in the clear language of the contract."" Parks Real Estate Purchasing Grp. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 472 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). ""[W]e begin with the terms of the [policy] itself to see if the intent of the parties can be gleaned without resort to extrinsic evidence."" Hugo Boss Fashions, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 608, 617 (2d Cir. 2001). Here, as in Hugo Boss, the policy fails to define ""customers"" or ""clients."" As is relevant here, Hugo Boss teaches that a court may find a policy term unambiguous where that term has a clear meaning in federal law.
In the absence of guidance from the policy language, courts ask whether a body of law or an established custom or usage provides a definition. ""For it is quite possible that even where a contract does not define a particular—and potentially ambiguous—term, a body of state law or an established custom fills in the gaps left by the drafters."" Id. Hugo Boss makes clear that federal law can similarly serve to fill such a gap:
[U]nder these conditions—where neither the contract nor state law defines a disputed term—a court may, nevertheless, find the term, as used in a state-law contract, to be unambiguous. For contracting parties operate against the backdrop not only of state law, but of federal law as well. And when federal law concepts, such as those relevant to trademark—paradigmatically a federal field—are employed, the parties may be read as having incorporated established meanings and definitions forged in the relevant federal cases.
Id. at 618.
The district court properly relied on custom and usage of the terms ""customers"" in determining that the retail investors were ""customers"" of NASDAQ within the meaning of the ACE D&O policy. Similar to trademark law, securities law is ""paradigmatically a federal field."" Id. ""In assessing whether there is [] a prevailing federal definition, we consider not whether there is complete unanimity among the courts that have addressed the question, but rather whether there is an overwhelming current of judicial opinion, that is, a meaning used by the vast majority of federal courts."" CGS Indus. Inc. v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 720 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).
We have little trouble finding that the vast majority of federal courts to consider the issue find retail investors to be ""customers"" of a stock exchange. In Lank v. New York Stock Exchange, our Court held that ""[t]he primary purpose of the Exchange Act was to protect customers of the stock exchanges that is, public investors."" 548 F.2d 61, 64 (2d Cir. 1977) (emphasis added). ""One method of effectuating this was to impose on the exchanges a statutory duty to protect investors by regulating (the exchanges') members."" Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). District courts also regularly characterize retail investors as ""customers"" of stock exchanges. See, e.g., Matter of Lake States Commodities, Inc., 936 F. Supp. 1461, 1469 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (""[T]he Second Circuit [has] construed the NYSE constitution and rules as intending to provide customers of the exchange with the right to force members into arbitration over disputes""), abrogated on other grounds by Damato v. Hermanson, 153 F.3d 464 (7th Cir. 1998); Carr v. New York Stock Exch., Inc., 414 F. Supp. 1292, 1298 (N.D. Cal. 1976) (""In enforcing its rules and in making complex decisions on the suspension or forced liquidation of members, the Exchange must consider the often conflicting interests of the member firm, its partners, and investors, and the corporations whose securities are handled by the firm, as well as the Exchange's public customers.""); New York Stock Exch., Inc. v. Sloan, 1980 WL 1431, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 1980) (""[The New York Stock Exchange's] right to relief is predicated upon its subrogation to the rights of its customers.""). It appears most federal courts take the meaning of ""customer"" in this context ""as a given."" Hugo Boss, 252 F.3d at 619.
Beazley argues that the district court erred in turning to federal law to provide a definition for ""customer,"" primarily because (1) industry usage should be considered before federal case law; (2) the professional services exclusion was standard language, thus its terms cannot be defined in the context of a specific industry; and (3) other evidence in the record indicates that NASDAQ considered broker-dealers, not retail investors, to be NASDAQ's customers. We find these arguments unavailing.
First, in this context, there is little distinction between looking to ""industry usage"" and federal case law to define a term. Federal case law is simply another way of determining whether the parties shared a common language that would lead them to a mutual, unambiguous understanding of the meaning of an undefined term. Second, the fact that the professional services exclusion is a standard clause does not alter the analysis here. The parties are not required to tailor language for every policy in order for terms to have industry-specific meanings. Who counts as a customer of a particular insured within the meaning of the generic exclusion will often depend on the nature of the industry in which the insured does business. What is relevant here is that the insurer sold the policy to its insured, a stock exchange, against the backdrop of well-established federal securities law that unambiguously considers retail investors to be customers of the exchange.
Third, a 2012 rule change NASDAQ submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot bear the weight Beazley assigns it. There, NASDAQ sought to provide accommodation payments to members who could demonstrate losses stemming from the ill-fated Facebook IPO that the members, in turn, could use to pay claims from retail investors. The rule change would make $62 million available to pay claims from retail investors, rather than the $500,000 then available to each member. In submitting the rule change, NASDAQ stated that ""[NASDAQ02b9s] business and legal relationships are with its members, not its members' customers. [NASDAQ] has no contractual or other relationships with its members' customers, and generally does not possess information about interactions between a member and its customer that may underlie members' trading activity."" App'x at 2578.
Beazley argues this language, at a minimum, raises a question of material fact as to whether NASDAQ considered retail investors its customers. However, as the district court correctly concluded, the fact that retail investors are customers of NASDAQ's member broker-dealers does not mean that retail investors were not also NASDAQ's customers. Broker-dealers are simply agents of the retail investors, performing ""the narrow task of consummating the transaction requested."" Press v. Chem. Inv. Servs. Corp., 166 F.3d 529, 536 (2d Cir. 1999). Retail investors may be customers both of NASDAQ and of NASDAQ's members.
We agree with the district court that when considered against the background of the ""the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business,"" the term ""customers"" of NASDAQ unambiguously includes retail investors. Morgan Stanley Grp. Inc. v. New England Ins. Co., 225 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir. 2000). We need not reach the parties' arguments regarding the import of extrinsic evidence in the record.
II. Professional services
To successfully invoke the exclusion, ACE also must demonstrate that the claims arose out of the ""rendering of or failure to render professional services."" Under New York law, a court makes such a determination by examining whether the asserted claim could succeed but for the excluded conduct. See Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Creative Hous. Ltd., 88 N.Y.2d 347, 350 (1996) (""[I]f no cause of action would exist but for the [excluded conduct], the claim is based on [the excluded conduct] and the exclusion applies""); Hugo Boss, 252 F.3d at 623 n.15 (applying ""but for"" test to breach of contract policy exclusion). ""In other words, if the plaintiff in an underlying action or proceeding alleges the existence of facts clearly falling within such an exclusion, and none of the causes of action that he or she asserts could exist but for the existence of the excluded activity or state of affairs, the insurer is under no obligation to defend the action."" Scottsdale Indem. Co. v. Beckerman, 992 N.Y.S.2d 117, 121 (2d Dep't 2014).
In determining whether a professional service is at issue, courts ""[look] to the nature of the conduct under scrutiny rather than the title or position of those involved, as well as to the underlying complaint. . . ."" David Lerner Assocs., Inc. v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., 934 F. Supp. 2d 533, 541 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Reliance Ins. Co. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., 691 N.Y.S.2d 458, 460 (1st Dep't 1999). ""[T]he question of whether one is engaged in a professional service depends on whether those individuals `acted with the special acumen and training of professionals when they engaged in the acts . . .'"" Id. (citation omitted).
Here, as below, the parties do not ""dispute that the design and operation of NASDAQ's systems require the special acumen and training of professionals, such that these activities constitute professional services."" Beazley II, 197 F. Supp. 3d at 628 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state law negligence claims set forth in the CAC were based on the allegation that NASDAQ ""failed to use reasonable care in the design, testing, and implementation"" of its systems. App'x at 164. Again, as below, the parties do not dispute that the negligence claims arose out of NASDAQ's alleged failure to properly render professional services, such that the exclusion applies.
Beazley, however, argues that the district court erred in finding that the CAC's federal securities claims were ""alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering or failure to render professional services."" Beazley argues that the CAC allegations accusing NASDAQ of misstatements and omissions in violation of federal securities law are advertisements for NASDAQ's services, and thus do not fall under the professional services exclusion. Beazley notes that the CAC pleads that ""NASDAQ and its executives . . . undertook an aggressive marketing and commercial campaign to persuade Facebook to list its securities on the NASDAQ Stock Market."" App'x at 472 ¶ 17. ""In doing do, Defendants Greifeld and Ewing caused NASDAQ to promote the reliability and capability of its technology and electronic trading platform . . . in the months leading up to the Facebook IPO."" Id. Beazley argues that these representations were made with the intent of promoting NASDAQ as the best exchange for the Facebook IPO. As advertising, Beazley argues, the statements ""are not actions that are based upon, arise out of, or that are attributable to the rendering of or failure to render professional services.""
Beazley relies on Rob Levine & Assocs. Ltd. v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am., 994 F. Supp. 2d 228 (D.R.I. 2014) for the proposition that actions taken to promote a business are not professional services. In Rob Levine, the complaint alleged that the defendant law firm engaged in false advertising that gave ""the false impression to future clients that [they] have special expertise in personal injury cases and disability cases and will recover more money than other Rhode Island lawyers."" Id. at 232. The law firm sought coverage from its insurer, which disclaimed based on a professional services exclusion that denied coverage ""based upon or arising out of any Wrongful Act related to the rendering of, or failure to render, professional services."" Id. The district court found the exclusion did not apply, because the deceptive advertisement claim is ""about advertising, not about the provision of legal services."" Id. at 233. Other courts also hold that advertising is not a professional service. See, e.g., Standard Mut. Ins. Co. v. Lay, 2 N.E.3d 1253, 1259 (Ill. App. Ct. 2014) (professional services exclusion did not apply to advertising claim); Corky McMillin Constr. Servs. v. U.S. Specialty Ins. Co., 597 Fed. App'x 925, 926-27 (9th Cir. 2015) (professional exclusion did not apply to misstatements in marketing and advertising materials).
The flaw in this argument is that the CAC plaintiffs could not win at trial merely by showing that NASDAQ made false and misleading statements as to its capabilities. ""To prevail on the merits in a private securities fraud action, investors must demonstrate that the defendant's deceptive conduct caused their claimed economic loss."" Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. 804, 807 (2011). ""This requirement is commonly referred to as `loss causation.'"" Id. The CAC recognizes this, and pleads loss causation based on failures in the technical service provided by NASDAQ:
[D]amages [to the class members] were foreseeable and directly caused by the materialization of the concealed risks of Defendants NASDAQ, Greifeld and Ewing; namely, NASDAQ's technology and trading platform technical limitations and resulting failures, including the breakdown of its IPO Cross system, and Defendants' failure to properly test NASDAQ's systems prior to the IPO. The materialization of these risks occurred during the Class Period when NASDAQ's systems failed to: (i) properly execute Class Members' buy and sell pre-market Cross orders and aftermarket orders in Facebook's IPO; and (ii) failed to timely deliver confirmations of Class Members[`] pre-market Cross orders, causing Class Members substantial damages.
App'x at 123-24 ¶ 238. The CAC thus attributes plaintiffs' losses to NASDAQ's failure to ""properly execute"" the purchase and sale orders and deliver timely confirmations, not to NASDAQ's marketing of itself to Facebook as the best exchange to handle the IPO. Failures to properly execute orders and deliver timely order confirmations go to the heart of NASDAQ's provision of professional services. The district court correctly determined that the professional services exclusion applies.
CONCLUSION
We have considered the remainder of Beazley's arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons given above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. As the Illinois National policy follows the ACE D&O policy, we need not reach the alternate grounds for affirmance proffered by Illinois National.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Le Nan Chen, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a May 17, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a February 19, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Chen's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Le Nan Chen, No. A201 128 213 (B.I.A. May 17, 2016), aff'g No. A201 128 213 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 19, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ's and BIA's decisions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008).
The agency may, ""[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,"" base an adverse credibility determination on an applicant's ""demeanor, candor, or responsiveness,"" as well as inconsistencies in an applicant's statements, between an applicant's and witness's testimony, or between an applicant's testimony and other record evidence, regardless of whether any such discrepancies ""go[] to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64. ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless . . . it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167.
Two material inconsistencies regarding Chen's practice of Christianity in the United States provide substantial evidence for the IJ's adverse credibility determination. Chen's testimony that he had attended church every Wednesday since December 2010 conflicted with a letter from his church, which states that he had attended only 31 to 35 times between January 2011 and August 2013. The IJ reasonably declined to credit Chen's explanation that he sometimes forgot to sign in because it contradicted his prior testimony that he signed in every time he attended church. Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (quotation marks omitted)).
Additionally, while Chen testified that he met his church witness in the summer of 2011, Chen's witness testified that he met Chen in the summer of 2013. Chen gave no explanation for this two-year discrepancy. Particularly when considered together, these inconsistencies about the length and frequency of Chen's church attendance in the United States undermine his claim that he is a practicing Christian. In turn, the lack of credibility about that fact calls into question whether Chen was a practicing Christian in China and whether he suffered persecution on account of that practice. Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. 2007) (""[A] single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to petitioner) infect the balance of the alien's uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence."").
The adverse credibility determination is further bolstered by the IJ's demeanor finding, to which we defer. Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 2006) (""We can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant's demeanor where, as here, they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony."").
These material inconsistencies relating to Chen's practice of Christianity, as well as the IJ's demeanor finding, provide substantial evidence for the adverse credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Because Chen's claims were all based on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the petition for review be DENIED.
Diodio Casset and Djiguiba Kamara petition for review of the denial of their applications for cancellation of removal before the Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA""). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.
Casset and Kamara petitioned for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), which provides relief from removal for an alien who can establish, among other qualifications, ""physica[l] presen[ce] in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years."" 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). Because the ""continuous period"" for the purposes of the statutory scheme ends when the alien is served a Notice to Appear (""NTA""), Casset and Kamara must show physical presence beginning in February 1999. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1); Tablie v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir. 2006). Continuous physical presence is broken if the alien departs from the United States for longer than 90 days or for any periods that, in the aggregate, exceed 180 days. 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(2).
Casset is a national of Senegal who has resided in the United States since at least 2001. Her husband, Kamara, is a national of Cote d'Ivoire who has resided in the United States since at least 2004. Casset's business visitor status expired in September 2001 and Kamara's nonimmigrant LULAC status expired in January 2008, so both have been living in the United States without authorization. On February 10, 2009, The Department of Homeland Security (""DHS"") served Casset and Kamara with NTAs and initiated removal proceedings.
Casset and Kamara both claimed before the immigration judge (""IJ"") that they arrived in the United States in 1998. To support her entry date, Casset submitted a letter from the New York Language Center purporting to show that she enrolled in an ESL course in March 1998. She also provided her Senegalese passport, which showed a visa issued on July 16, 1999 as her earliest entry date to the United States. She could not produce any further evidence, but asserts that the documentation showing her prior arrival no longer exists due to circumstances involving an abusive former spouse in Senegal. At the hearing, she also acknowledged three trips back to Senegal between 1999 and 2001, but could not recall or prove their specific duration.
Kamara testified that he entered the United States in 1998 using another person's passport and visa, but could provide no documentary evidence supporting that date. The only corroboration was a sworn statement from his cousin stating that Kamara lived with him in the United States in 1998. Kamara also testified that he spent 89 days out of the country, leaving in March 2004 and reentering on June 15, 2004 using his brother's passport. Again there is no documentary support.
The IJ concluded that Casset and Kamara had failed to sustain their burden of establishing continuous physical presence in the United States for ten years, and the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. See 8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The agency found the corroborating evidence submitted to support Kamara's 1998 entry unpersuasive.[1] Additionally, the IJ and BIA agreed that neither Casset nor Kamara had shown that their trips abroad did not exceed 90 days individually or 180 days in the aggregate.
""[W]e review the agency's factual findings only to determine whether they are `supported by substantial evidence,' but we review its `conclusion of law de novo.'"" Huo Qiang Chen v. Holder, 773 F.3d 396, 403 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Niang v. Holder, 762 F.3d 251, 253 (2d Cir. 2014)). The substantial evidence standard is ""highly deferential,"" and the ""agency's factual findings are `conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'"" Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)). The IJ and BIA have the power to assess whether a petitioner's testimony ""is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that"" the burden of proof was satisfied, or whether additional documentation is required. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B).
The agency's determination that Kamara and Casset failed to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal was reasonable. With respect to Kamara, the IJ and BIA considered his and his cousin's bare statements as to a 1998 arrival date, but found them unconvincing. Kamara lacked any documented proof of when he actually arrived in the country, and the self-serving testimony of the petitioners and their family members was not independently reliable absent corroborating evidence. See Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 334 (2d Cir. 2013) (failing to find ""solid support"" in the form of corroborating evidence of statements by alien and other interested parties). We defer to the weight that the IJ and BIA assign to the evidence they review, and the agency's determination that the testimony and limited documentation was deficient and unpersuasive was not manifestly unreasonable. See Argueta v. Holder, 617 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir. 2010); Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, 516 F.3d 35, 36 (2d Cir. 2008).
Turning to Casset, even accepting that she arrived in the United States on March 4, 1998, she fails to meet her burden to establish ""continuous presence"" between her claimed arrival date in 1998 and the service of her NTA. 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1)-(2). Casset testified that she left the country during the ten-year statutory period, but could not recall—much less substantiate—her dates of return and the duration of her exodus. She thus failed to provide the basic information required to satisfy the elements for relief. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B) (requiring ""specific facts"" of departure and entry to make a showing of continuous presence).
The agency therefore reasonably determined that neither petitioner established ten years' continuous physical presence in the United States. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(4)(A), 1229b(d)(2).
For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Casset and Kamara's other arguments, we hereby DENY the petition for review.
[1]  The Government advises by letter that petitioner Casset may have indeed arrived in the United States on March 4, 1998, as she claims, and that it withdraws its arguments disputing her date of arrival. We therefore will not consider the agency's finding that Casset failed to establish her first date of arrival in the United States ten or more years before her NTA was issued.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Gurpreet Singh, a native and citizen of India, seeks review of a June 14, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a June 11, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Singh's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Gurpreet Singh, No. A200 945 869 (B.I.A. June 14, 2016), aff'g No. A200 945 869 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 11, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as modified and supplemented by the BIA. See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005); Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008) (reviewing adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard); Pierre v. Holder, 588 F.3d 767, 772 (2d Cir. 2009) (reviewing constitutional claims de novo).
Adverse Credibility Determination
""Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on . . . the consistency between the applicant's or witness's account, the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements . . ., the internal consistency of each such statement, [and] the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record . . . without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64. Substantial evidence supports the agency's determination that Singh was not credible as to his claim that Congress Party members attacked him in India on account of his membership in the Shiromani Akali Dal Mann.
The agency reasonably relied on Singh's inconsistent testimony regarding whether he had contemplated traveling to the United States prior to his alleged persecution. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67. The IJ also reasonably relied on record inconsistencies regarding whether Singh broke his arm or dislocated his shoulder, and whether he was hospitalized for two weeks. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3. Singh did not provide compelling explanations for these inconsistencies. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The agency also reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Singh's assertion that he was beaten twice in 2010, and affidavits from his father and village leader that those beatings took place in 2009. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67. Although a reasonable fact finder could have credited Singh's explanation that his father mistakenly recalled the date and provided the incorrect date to the village leader, the IJ was not compelled to credit this explanation: Singh testified that the village leader visited Singh in the hospital and accompanied Singh to the police station. See Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80.
Contrary to Singh's contention, the IJ did not fault him for failing to provide additional corroborating evidence, but rather reasonably noted that the corroborating evidence he had submitted did not rehabilitate his credibility. See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (""An applicant's failure to corroborate . . . testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.""). As discussed above, the affidavits from Singh's father and village leader and his medical certificate were inconsistent with his statements. Furthermore, a letter from Singh's political party omitted mention of the attacks Singh claimed to have suffered.
Given the inconsistency findings, the agency's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 165-66. That determination is dispositive of Singh's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three claims are based on the same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
Due Process Claim
Singh argues that his due process rights were violated because the interpreter at his hearing before the IJ spoke a different dialect. ""To establish a violation of due process, an alien must show that []he was denied a full and fair opportunity to present h[is] claims or that [he was] otherwise deprived . . . of fundamental fairness."" Burger v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Singh did not demonstrate that the translator deprived him a full and fair opportunity to present his claims.
At his hearing, Singh stated that he speaks and understands Punjabi best, and he never raised any difficulty understanding the interpreter. Singh has not identified any aspects of his testimony that were improperly translated, suggesting only that the transcript contains incomplete sentences reflecting a lack of communication. As support, Singh cites the IJ instructing the interpreter not to continue translating once an objection was sustained, the IJ asking whether the translator had said the number 13 or 30, the interpreter asking for a break to drink water, the interpreter asking for a question posed in English to be repeated, and an attorney asking whether the interpreter had said the word father. None of these examples casts doubt on the interpreter's translation of the substance of Singh's testimony.
Accordingly, because Singh did not complain about the translator at his hearing and does not identify any incorrectly translated testimony, Singh fails to demonstrate that he was deprived of a fair hearing. See id. at 134.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT=S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Yuji Jin, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a June 16, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a February 4, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Jin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Yuji Jin, No. A087 446 554 (B.I.A. June 16, 2016), aff'g No. A087 446 554 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 4, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
In lieu of filing a brief, the Government moves for summary denial of Jin's petition for review. Summary denial is warranted only if a petition is frivolous, Pillay v. INS, 45 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir. 1995). As Jin has filed a merits brief, we treat the Government's motion as a response to that brief, and deny the petition.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA. Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005); Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008). ""Considering the totality of the circumstances,"" the agency may base an adverse credibility determination on discrepancies between an applicant's oral and written statements and between an applicant's statements and other record evidence, as well as ""any other relevant factor."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-65. ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless. . . it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. Substantial evidence supports the agency's adverse credibility ruling.
Jin testified that in 2013 Chinese police went to her home in China and told her husband that she would be arrested upon return to China if she did not cease her pro-democracy activities. Jin's amended asylum application, however, submitted less than a month before her hearing, omitted this incident. This omission alone is substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination. Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166 n.3 (""An inconsistency and an omission are . . . functionally equivalent.""); Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 295 (2d Cir. 2006) (""[A] material inconsistency in an aspect of [an applicant's] story that served as an example of the very persecution from which he sought asylum . . . afforded substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility finding."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This visit was central to proving Jin's alleged fear of persecution on account of her Chinese Freedom and Democracy Party (""CFDP"") activities, and its omission calls into question whether the Chinese government was aware of her activities. Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir. 2008) (""[T]o establish a well-founded fear of persecution in the absence of any evidence of past persecution, an alien must make some showing that authorities in his country of nationality are either aware of his activities or likely to become aware of his activities.""). Given the centrality of this omission and Jin's last-minute attempt to supplement her application at her hearing, the agency reasonably concluded that she was not credible. Xian Tuan Ye, 446 F.3d at 295; Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. 2007). Moreover, the agency was not required to accept Jin's explanation that she forgot to include this incident because she had known about it since 2013 and it was the primary reason she feared persecution in China. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Additionally, that there was no letter from Jin's husband corroborating this incident further undermined Jin's credibility. Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (""An applicant's failure to corroborate [her] . . . testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.""). Although Jin testified that her husband was afraid to send a letter, the agency was not compelled to accept the explanation, especially given Jin's submissions of letters from her father and cousin in China regarding past encounters with Chinese officials. Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80-81.
Because this omission and lack of corroborating evidence constitute substantial evidence supproting the adverse credibility determination, see Xian Tuan Ye, 446 F.3d at 295; Biao Yang, 496 F.3d at 273, and because Jin's claims for asylum, withholding, and CAT relief were all based on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of all three. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the Government's motion for summary denial is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Sun Hua Ye, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a March 21, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a December 9, 2014, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Ye's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Sun Hua Ye, No. A200 738 536 (B.I.A. Mar. 21, 2016), aff'g No. A200 738 536 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. Dec. 9, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented.
Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA. See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). Because the petition challenges only factual findings, we will grant Ye relief only if ""no reasonable fact-finder could have"" made those findings. Wu Biao Chen v. INS, 344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (quoting Diallo v. INS, 232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir. 2000)). The principal issue raised by the petition is whether Ye met his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum.
To qualify for asylum, Ye had to demonstrate that he (1) engaged in ""other resistance"" to China's family planning policy, and (2) suffered harm rising to the level of persecution or had a well-founded fear of suffering such harm as a direct result of his resistance. Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 494 F.3d 296, 313 (2d Cir. 2007) (en banc). Assuming, as the agency did, that Ye engaged in ""other resistance"" to China's family-planning policy, we find no error in the agency's conclusion that Ye failed to show past harm rising to the level of persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.
1. Ye argues that he suffered past persecution when he was struck twice in the chest immediately before—and additional times during—his 12-hour detention. In assessing whether physical harm rises to the level of persecution, the agency must take account of the context of that harm. See Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam). As we have acknowledged, a ""minor beating . . . may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention."" Beskovic v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, ""[w]e have never held that a beating that occurs within the context of an arrest or detention constitutes persecution per se."" Jian Qiu Liu, 632 F.3d at 822. The harm suffered by the petitioner must be sufficiently severe, rising above ""mere harassment."" Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006).
The agency considered the context of Ye's harm and reasonably concluded that it did not rise to the level of persecution. Ye was punched in the chest a few times during a single 12-hour period, he did not require medical attention, and he did not suffer any lasting injuries. In Jian Qiu Liu, we observed that comparable physical abuse before detention was not persecution. See 632 F.3d at 821-22 (deeming reasonable the BIA's finding of no persecution when the petitioner was ""punched [] repeatedly in the face, chest, and back"" by family planning officials and detained for two days, because ""he suffered only minor bruising from [the] altercation,"" ""required no formal medical attention[,] and had no lasting physical effect""). The same conduct during detention warrants no different conclusion here.
Ye's citation to Edimo-Doualla v. Gonzales, in which we remanded for the BIA to consider whether the petitioner had been persecuted despite having suffered no ""permanent or serious injury,"" does not support a finding of unreasonableness in this case. 464 F.3d 276, 283-84 (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner in Edimo-Doualla suffered substantially greater harm than did Ye, including ""four beatings during a 1991 arrest; a two-day arrest in 1996; multiple beatings and other forms of abuse during a three-to-five-day arrest in 1997; a brief detention . . . in 2000""; ""multiple beatings in 2000 during each of six days that [he] was held at a police station; and a three-month prison term"" during which he was ""forced to bathe with a bucket of water mixed with urine."" Id. at 283. While Ye's treatment was deplorable, the agency's decision that it did not rise to the level of persecution was reasonable on this record.
2. Ye argues that it should be inferred from the fact that his wife was involuntarily sterilized in China that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution there. However, the law is clear that Ye cannot automatically establish a well-founded fear of future persecution based on harm suffered by his wife. See Shi Liang Lin, 494 F.3d at 309-10. And as the agency reasonably concluded, Ye's fear is not ""objectively reasonable."" Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). There is little reason to think that Ye will face mistreatment rising to the level of persecution from family planning officials: Ye and his wife have already been punished for violating China's family planning policy, and they cannot conceive another child together. Moreover, Ye's wife (who remains in China) has suffered no harassment by the authorities after she paid the family planning fine. See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, 191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding that a claimed fear of future persecution is undermined when similarly-situated family members remain unharmed in the petitioner's native country). There is no evidence in the record to compel a conclusion different from the one reached by the agency.
Given that the agency reasonably found that Ye failed to demonstrate both past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution, it did not err in denying him asylum. For the same reason, the agency did not err in denying Ye withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, both of which require even greater showings. Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2010).
We have considered all of Ye's arguments and conclude that they are without merit. The petition for review is DENIED. Any stay of removal previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Jiayang Xu, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a January 19, 2016 decision of the BIA affirming an August 1, 2014 decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Xu's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). See In re Jiayang Xu, No. A205 436 888 (B.I.A. Jan. 19, 2016), aff'g No. A205 436 888 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. Aug. 1, 2014). Where, as here, the BIA does not expressly ""adopt"" the IJ's decision, but closely tracks its reasoning, we review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006), applying well-established standards of review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Su Chun Hu v. Holder, 579 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir. 2009). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.
Absent past persecution, an alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating a well-founded fear of future persecution, which is a ""subjective fear that is objectively reasonable."" Dong Zhong Zheng v. Mukasey, 552 F.3d 277, 284 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2). ""An asylum applicant can show a well-founded fear of future persecution in two ways: (1) by demonstrating that he or she `would be singled out individually for persecution' if returned, or (2) by proving the existence of a `pattern or practice in [the] . . . country of nationality . . . of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant' and establishing his or her `own inclusion in, and identification with, such group.'"" Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)). To do this, ""an alien must make some showing that authorities in [her] country of nationality are either aware of [her] activities or likely to become aware of [her] activities."" Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir. 2008).
The agency here reasonably determined that Xu failed to show a reasonable possibility that she would be singled out individually for persecution. Although Xu pointed to three instances in which she proselytized publicly and approximately fifteen articles about religion that she published to a blog, her claim that the Chinese government is aware of these activities is purely speculative. See Jian Xing Huang v. U.S. INS, 421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that ""[i]n the absence of solid support in the record,"" fear of persecution is ""speculative at best"" and not objectively reasonable); Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d at 334 (rejecting premise that ""Chinese government is aware of every anti-Communist or pro-democracy piece of commentary published online"").
Regarding her prospective practice, Xu testified that she would worship at an unauthorized church in China and proselytize. In essence, she alleged that the Chinese authorities would become aware of her future activities in China and persecute her for them because there is a pattern or practice of such persecution. But the agency reasoned that she did not establish any pattern or practice of persecution. The State Department report, of which the agency took administrative notice, reflects that tens of millions of unregistered Christians worship in China, so it is unlikely that Chinese officials would discover Xu's practice and single her out for harm. See Jian Xing Huang v. U.S. INS, 421 F.3d at 129. Although Xu argues that the IJ failed to consider whether the government was more likely to discover her practice because she would proselytize, the IJ considered that fact, but found that the country conditions evidence did not support Xu's claim.
We identify no error in this finding. To establish a pattern or practice of persecution against a particular group, an applicant must demonstrate that the harm to that group is ""systemic or pervasive."" In re A----M----, 23 I. & N. Dec. 737, 741 (B.I.A. 2005); see Mufied v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir. 2007). Here, Xu testified that she did not personally know anyone who was persecuted in China, and the State Department's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report stated that in some parts of China ""local authorities tacitly approved of . . . the activities of unregistered religious groups or did not interfere with [them]."" SPA 1. Given the nationwide variation in and lack of evidence of persecution in Xu's home province of Liaoning, the agency reasonably concluded that Xu failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in her region of China. See Santoso v. Holder, 580 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming agency determination that petitioner unlikely to experience future persecution as Catholic where evidence suggested that persecution was ""occurring on a very localized basis and was not countrywide""); cf. Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 142, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (identifying no error in BIA framework requiring evidence of local enforcement of family-planning policy, given regional variations in enforcement).
Accordingly, because the agency reasonably found that Xu failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, it did not err in denying asylum or in concluding that she necessarily failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal or CAT relief. See Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2010).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Michael Noel Anthony Hammond, a native and citizen of Jamaica, seeks review of a July 25, 2016 decision of the BIA denying his June 2016 motion to reconsider his 2003 removal order. In re Michael Noel Anthony Hammond, No. A037 215 537 (B.I.A. July 25, 2016). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the challenged order. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A)-(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). It is undisputed that Hammond's June 2016 motion to reconsider was untimely because his removal order became final in 2003, 13 years earlier. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B). Here, reconsideration was available only under the BIA's sua sponte authority. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Despite this procedural posture, we retain jurisdiction to review Hammond's U.S. citizenship claim. Duarte-Ceri v. Holder, 630 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 2010). We review the derivative citizenship claim de novo, deferring to the BIA's reasonable interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (""INA""). Brissett v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).
In determining whether Hammond derived citizenship through his mother's naturalization, we look to the law in effect at the time Hammond claims he fulfilled the last requirement for derivative citizenship. Bueno Gil v. Sessions, 851 F.3d 184, 186 (2d Cir. 2017). In 1987, when Hammond's mother naturalized, the law governing derivative citizenship provided in relevant part:
A child born outside of the United States of alien parents . . . becomes a citizen of the United States upon . . . [t]he naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents . . . if . . . [s]uch naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years.
8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (1987), repealed by Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106-395, § 103, 114 Stat. 1631, 1632 (2000).
The only issue in this case is whether Hammond's parents were legally separated in 1987, when his mother naturalized. See Brissett, 363 F.3d at 132. Legal separation under § 1432(a)(3) requires more than a de facto separation between married parents: it ""requires a formal act which, under the laws of the state or nation having jurisdiction of the marriage, alters the marital relationship either by terminating the marriage (as by divorce) or by mandating or recognizing the separate existence of the marital parties."" Id. at 134.
Hammond argues that his parents were legally separated under Jamaica's Matrimonial Causes Act. See Matrimonial Causes Act (Jamaica) (Jan. 6, 1989). As the Government argues, the Matrimonial Causes Act did not take effect until 1989, and thus it cannot provide a basis for a legal separation pre-dating Hammond's mother's naturalization in 1987 or Hammond's 18th birthday in 1988. Furthermore, Hammond has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his parents took formal action to have their separation recognized under the Act or any other Jamaican law. We thus uphold the BIA's conclusion that Hammond did not meet § 1432(a)(3)'s legal separation requirement and so did not derive U.S. citizenship when his mother naturalized.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. It is further ORDERED that Hammond's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Jian Lin, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a December 20, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming a February 5, 2016, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Lin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Jian Lin, No. A200 294 186 (B.I.A. Dec. 20, 2016), aff'g No. A200 294 186 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 5, 2016). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions ""for the sake of completeness."" Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008).
""Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on . . . the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements. . . ., the internal consistency of each such statement, [and] the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record . . . without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64.
Substantial evidence supports the agency's determination that Lin was not credible as to his claim that Chinese officials detained and harmed him on account of his distribution of religious flyers or as to his continuing practice of Christianity in the United States.
The agency reasonably relied on record inconsistencies regarding whether Chinese police broke several of Lin's ribs and whether he was unable to attend church for his first two years in the United States because he was living in Virginia and there was no church there where Chinese was spoken. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67 & n.3. Lin did not provide compelling explanations for these inconsistencies. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The agency reasonably relied further on his failure to rehabilitate Lin's credibility with reliable corroborating evidence. ""An applicant's failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question."" Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007). As the agency noted, Lin failed to provide any evidence to corroborate his claim that police broke his ribs, or that he attends church weekly in the United States. Furthermore, the agency did not err in declining to credit Lin's mother's unsworn letter, in which she claimed to have bailed him out of jail and witnessed his injuries. See Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 334 (2d Cir. 2013) (deferring to agency's decision to afford little weight to relative's letter because it was unsworn and from an interested witness).
Given the inconsistencies and the lack of corroboration, the agency's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. That determination is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three claims are based on the same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
Rulings by summary order do not have precedential effect. Citation to a summary order filed on or after January 1, 2007, is permitted and is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this Court's Local Rule 32.1.1. When citing a summary order in a document filed with this Court, a party must cite either the Federal Appendix or an electronic database (with the notation ""summary order""). A party citing a summary order must serve a copy of it on any party not represented by counsel.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Ivonne Maribel Bajana Caicedo (""Caicedo"") seeks review of an October 31, 2016 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") denying her motion to remand based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and affirming an immigration judge's decision pretermitting her application for cancellation of removal. In re Ivonne Maribel Bajana Caicedo, No. A 047 389 247 (B.I.A. Oct. 31, 2016), aff'g No. A 047 389 247 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 15, 2015). Caicedo argues that the BIA erred when it ruled that she failed to follow the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, related to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.
We review the BIA's factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo. Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). Lozada mandates that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by 1) an affidavit detailing the agreement between the applicant and former counsel; 2) evidence that notice was given to former counsel of the allegations, with adequate time for response; and 3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the applicant has filed a complaint regarding counsel's conduct with the appropriate disciplinary authorities or, if not, a statement why the applicant has not done so. Garcia-Martinez v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 511, 512 n.1 (2d Cir. 2006).
The BIA ruled that Caicedo failed to comply with the procedures set forth in Lozada, finding, among other things, that she did not ""set forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard,"" and failed to submit sufficient evidence that she notified her prior counsel. Upon review of the record, we agree that Caicedo failed to provide sufficient information regarding the agreement with former counsel regarding what action would be taken. Since we conclude that Caicedo failed to comply with the first Lozada requirement, we need not reach the other elements of her claim.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT=S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Feng Yan Wang, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a June 13, 2016, decision of the BIA affirming an August 20, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Wang's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Feng Yan Wang, No. A087 766 028 (B.I.A. June 13, 2016), aff'g No. A087 766 028 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 20, 2015). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
In lieu of filing a brief, the Government moves for summary denial of Wang's petition for review. Summary denial is warranted only if a petition is frivolous, Pillay v. INS, 45 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir. 1995), and Wang has filed her merits brief. Accordingly, we treat the Government's motion as a response to that brief, and deny the petition.
Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ's decision as supplemented and modified by the BIA. See Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 2007); Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008). The agency may, ""[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,"" base an adverse credibility determination on discrepancies between an applicant's oral and written statements, between an applicant's and her witness's testimony, or between an applicant's testimony and other record evidence. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64. ""An applicant's failure to corroborate . . . her testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question."" Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007). ""We defer . . . to an IJ's credibility determination unless . . . it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling."" Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167.
The BIA emphasized two discrepancies that, along with the lack of reliable corroborating evidence, provide substantial evidence for the adverse credibility ruling. First, the agency reasonably relied on Wang's conflicting descriptions of her mistreatment in detention. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). In her 2010 credible fear interview with an asylum officer, Wang stated that officers pulled her hair and slapped her face. When asked if anything else happened while she was detained, Wang said no. However, Wang's asylum application and testimony described multiple severe beatings during her three days in detention, resulting in bruises all over her body. While it is reasonable to assume that an alien's credible fear interview will be less detailed than her asylum application and hearing testimony, see Ming Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 725 (2d Cir. 2009), Wang's credible fear interview omitted significant details regarding her beatings, despite her being asked to add to her statement, and presented materially different accounts of her mistreatment, see Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 180-81 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that where initial statement and later testimony ""present materially different accounts of. . . persecution . . . the inconsistencies may render the alien's testimony incredible.""). The IJ reasonably relied on Wang's omission from her credible fear interview of any description of the severe harm she claims to have suffered in her asylum application and later testimony. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166 n.3 (""An inconsistency and an omission are . . . functionally equivalent."").
Wang's argument that the record of the credible fear interview was not reliable is unexhausted because Wang did not object to the admission of the credible fear record or raise any concerns about its reliability before the IJ or the BIA. Foster v. INS, 376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004) (requiring petitioner to raise issues to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review).
The agency also reasonably relied on Wang's varying descriptions of what she was doing when she was arrested. At her credible fear interview, Wang said that she and the others had just started reciting the Lord's Prayer when the police arrived. However, her application stated that they were reading the Bible when the police arrived. At the hearing, Wang initially testified that the police arrived during a prayer; but on cross examination, she testified that they had not yet started praying and were reading the Bible. Wang's explanation that the prayer and reading were simultaneous does not account for her testimony that the group had not yet started praying when the police arrived. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005) (""A petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for [her] inconsistent statements to secure relief; [s]he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In addition, Wang's story differed in another aspect: Wang testified that she learned the prayer when she read it in the Bible at that meeting; but at her credible fear interview, she said she had not read the Bible.
These discrepancies combine to provide substantial support for the determination that Wang is not credible because they call into question both whether she attended an underground church and whether she was mistreated in detention. Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d 166-67 & n.3; Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 295 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that a single material inconsistency relating to the persecution from which an applicant sought asylum provided substantial evidence for an adverse credibility determination).
The agency reasonably concluded that Wang's corroborating evidence did not rehabilitate her credibility. Biao Yang, 496 F.3d at 273. The agency was not required to credit the letter from Wang's church, as the author did not appear for cross examination and the letter suggested that Wang attended the church during a year that she lived outside of New York. Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir. 2006) (weight afforded to evidence ""lies largely within the discretion of the IJ"" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Wang's husband's testimony added inconsistency regarding the frequency of Wang's church attendance, and the agency reasonably gave diminished weight to the letters from Wang's aunt and friend in China because they were authored by witnesses not available for cross examination. Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 334 (2d Cir. 2013).
Given the discrepancies relating to Wang's church activities and mistreatment in China, as well as her lack of rehabilitative corroborating evidence, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency's adverse credibility determination. Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67; Xian Tuan Ye, 446 F.3d at 295-96; Biao Yang, 496 F.3d at 273. Because Wang's claims were all based on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the Government's motion for summary denial is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioner Jia Liu, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of a December 9, 2015, decision of the BIA affirming an April 8, 2014, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Liu's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Jia Liu, No. A 205 614 781 (B.I.A. Dec. 9, 2015), aff'g No. A 205 614 781 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 8, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
We have reviewed the IJ's decision as supplemented by the BIA. See Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The standards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4); Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513-14 (2d Cir. 2009); Cao v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2005).
The agency primarily denied relief on credibility grounds. The agency may, ""[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,"" base a credibility finding on ""the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements . . ., the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record . . ., and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements. . . ."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Here, the IJ's adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.
Liu's omission of his alleged detention and beating from his asylum application and direct examination testimony provides sufficient support for the agency's conclusion that he was not credible. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see Ye v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 446 F.3d 289, 295 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (concluding that a material inconsistency regarding an aspect of a claim that serves as an example of the persecution from which an applicant seeks asylum affords substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding); Lin, 534 F.3d at 166 n.3 (holding that, for purposes of analyzing a credibility determination, ""[a]n inconsistency and an omission are . . . functionally equivalent""). Liu's allegation on cross-examination that he was hit with batons, detained, and starved was his sole allegation of physical harm. Liu's written statement reported only that he was fired and threatened with prosecution. The agency was not required to accept Liu's explanation that all threats were tantamount to being hit and detained. Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (explaining that, on appeal, ""[a] petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony."" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). The IJ's adverse credibility determination is bolstered by Liu's failure to submit any corroborative evidence of his employment or his detention and beating. See Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (""An applicant's failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question."").
We find no error in the agency's alternative conclusion that Liu did not demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution in China on account of his religion. He did not prove that Chinese officials were aware or would become aware of his Christianity. See Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam). In addition, record evidence showed that millions of Christians in China practice in unregistered churches and that in some areas, authorities did not interfere with that practice. Moreover, the reports do not reveal any incidents of detention or mistreatment of underground church members or proselytizers in Liu's home province. See Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 142, 149, 169-70 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding no error in BIA's evidentiary framework requiring applicant to demonstrate that similarly situated individuals face persecution in his or her local area when enforcement varies by region); Santoso v. Holder, 580 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (denying petition where agency considered background materials and rejected pattern or practice claim because violence was localized, not countrywide).
Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Liu's motion to remand. Liu did not comply with the procedural requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Zheng v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (requiring substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A. 1988)).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is DENIED.
Petitioners Saudin and Danijela Agani, natives of Germany and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, seek review of a May 30, 2014, decision of the BIA affirming an August 9, 2012, decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Saudin Agani, Danijela Agani, Nos. A094 004 723/692 (B.I.A. May 30, 2014), aff'g No. A094 004 723/692 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 9, 2012). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
We have reviewed both the IJ's and BIA's decisions ""for the sake of completeness."" Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the agency's factual findings for substantial evidence, reversing only if ""any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary."" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). We review de novo questions of law, including the application of law to undisputed facts. Mirzoyan v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 217, 220 (2d Cir. 2006). Here, the agency reasonably concluded that the Aganis did not establish a likelihood of persecution or torture in either Bosnia and Herzegovina or Germany.
Persecution includes ""non-life threatening violence and physical abuse, or non-physical forms of harm such as the deliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage,"" but ""does not encompass mere harassment."" Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citations omitted). In the case of non-governmental persecution, the applicant must also demonstrate that the government is ""unwilling or unable to control"" the private actors. Ruqiang Yu v. Holder, 693 F.3d 294, 298 (2d Cir. 2012).
The agency properly declined to consider Saudin Agani's mistreatment as a child in Kosovo because Kosovo is not a country of removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). The agency also reasonably concluded that the Aganis did not establish that they would be singled out for persecution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of mixed ethnicity families in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); see Santoso v. Holder, 580 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir. 2009).
The Aganis also argue that their past treatment in Germany, considered cumulatively, amounted to persecution. See Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (past incidents of harm should be considered cumulatively). While this treatment may amount to unlawful harassment, the agency reasonably concluded that it did not rise to the level of persecution. See Ivanishvili, 433 F.3d at 341-42 (describing the difference between harassment and persecution).
Further, the record does not compel a conclusion that the Aganis will likely face persecution in Germany. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).
For the same reasons discussed above, the BIA reasonably found that the Aganis cannot show a likelihood of torture. Cf. Lecaj, 616 F.3d at 119-20.
We have considered the Aganis' remaining arguments and found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.

SUMMARY ORDER
RULINGS BY SUMMARY ORDER DO NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT. CITATION TO A SUMMARY ORDER FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, IS PERMITTED AND IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 32.1 AND THIS COURT'S LOCAL RULE 32.1.1. WHEN CITING A SUMMARY ORDER IN A DOCUMENT FILED WITH THIS COURT, A PARTY MUST CITE EITHER THE FEDERAL APPENDIX OR AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE (WITH THE NOTATION ""SUMMARY ORDER""). A PARTY CITING TO A SUMMARY ORDER MUST SERVE A COPY OF IT ON ANY PARTY NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA"") decision, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is GRANTED.
Petitioner Tengchang Ye, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, seeks review of an April 21, 2016 decision of the BIA affirming a September 29, 2014 decision of an Immigration Judge (""IJ"") denying Ye's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (""CAT""). In re Tengchang Ye, No. A205 301 355 (B.I.A. Apr. 21, 2016), aff'g No. A205 301 355 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 29, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.
Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ's decision as modified by the BIA and consider only the adverse credibility determination, which the BIA found dispositive. See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008).
The governing REAL ID Act credibility standard provides that the agency must ""[c]onsider[] the totality of the circumstances,"" and may base a credibility finding on an applicant's ""demeanor, candor, or responsiveness,"" the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies or omissions in his or his witness's statements, ""without regard to whether"" they go ""to the heart of the applicant's claim."" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 163-64, 166-67. For the reasons that follow, we are unable to conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency's determination that Ye was not credible.
Initially, the agency's adverse credibility determination is entirely based on discrepancies arising from Ye's credible fear interview; the agency did not assess, however, whether the interview record displayed the requisite ""hallmarks of reliability."" Ming Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 725 (2d Cir. 2009). A credible fear interview warrants ""close examination"" because it may ""be perceived as coercive"" or fail to ""elicit all of the details supporting an asylum claim."" Id. at 724-25. That is because ""an alien appearing at a credible fear interview has ordinarily been detained since his or her arrival in the United States and is therefore likely to be more unprepared, more vulnerable, and more wary of government officials than an asylum applicant who appears for an interview before immigration authorities well after arrival."" Id. at 724. Although a credible fear interview can be considered in assessing credibility if ""the record of a credible fear interview displays the hallmarks of reliability,"" id. at 725, the agency neither acknowledged this requirement nor assessed the reliability of Ye's credible fear interview record.
Moreover, the agency's adverse credibility determination is based on only one inconsistency involving the substance of Ye's claim: that between his statements at his credible fear interview and his later testimony about whether he was burned, or merely threatened, with a lit cigarette. Ye explained in his application that he misspoke during his credible fear interview, and he testified that the interviewer may have misunderstood him. In his decision, the IJ stated erroneously that, following instructions by the snakeheads, Ye admitted that he lied under oath about being burned with a cigarette. Ye did admit that he lied during his credible fear interview about the dates of his travel to the United States, and averred that he did so because his human trafficker threatened to harm his family if he did not conceal his smuggling information. But Ye did not advance this explanation for the discrepancy in his testimony about being threatened with a lit cigarette. The IJ thus misstated the record when rejecting Ye's explanation and erroneously failed to consider Ye's actual explanation. Id. See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir. 2005) (""Absent a reasoned evaluation of [the applicant's] explanations, the IJ's conclusion that his story is implausible was based on flawed reasoning and, therefore, cannot constitute substantial evidence supporting her conclusion."").
The remaining bases for the credibility determination relate only to the details of Ye's travel to the United States, i.e., whether he used his own passport, and the dates on which he departed China and arrived in the United States. Before the REAL ID Act took effect, we held that date discrepancies ""need not be fatal to credibility, especially if the errors are relatively minor and isolated, and do not concern material facts."" Diallo v. INS, 232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal citations omitted). Although the REAL ID Act allows an IJ to ""rely on any inconsistency . . . in making an adverse credibility determination,"" the ""totality of the circumstances"" must still support the determination that the applicant is not credible. Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. On appellate review, ""[w]e must assess whether the IJ has provided specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and whether those reasons bear a legitimate nexus to the finding."" Id. at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The agency made no attempt to explain why the four-day departure date discrepancy, three-day arrival date discrepancy, and inconsistency about whether Ye travelled on his own passport undermined the entirety of Ye's claim. The agency's failure to supply any reasoning in this regard precludes meaningful review of its analysis. See Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir. 2005) (""Despite our generally deferential review of IJ and BIA opinions, we require a certain minimum level of analysis from the IJ and BIA opinions denying asylum, and indeed must require such if judicial review is to be meaningful."").
We have additional concerns with the agency's reliance on possible inconsistencies in Ye's travel-related statements. For example, the IJ rejected Ye's explanation for the departure date discrepancy solely because Ye was under oath during his credible fear interview. This finding is in tension with our case law calling for ""close examination"" of credible fear interview statements because the interview may ""be perceived as coercive"" and the alien may be ""wary of government officials."" Ming Zhang, 585 F.3d at 724. For similar reasons, the IJ's rejection of Ye's explanation for the passport discrepancy is also troubling. Ye asserted that he concealed information during his credible fear interview at the human trafficker's direction, and under threat from the trafficker. The IJ rejected this explanation on the grounds that Ye was provided with an interpreter, waived the presence of counsel, and was under oath when he made the relevant statements. The IJ's references to an interpreter being present and to Ye waiving the presence of counsel do not clearly relate to Ye's explanation that he lied to prevent his smuggler from acting against his family in China, and do not reflect reasoned consideration of Ye's explanation. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166; Cao He Lin, 428 F.3d at 403. And, as noted above, the mere fact that Ye was under oath during his credible fear interview does not support the wholesale rejection of his explanation. See Ming Zhang, 585 F.3d at 724.
In light of the foregoing errors in the agency's credibility analysis, we are unable to conclude that substantial evidence supports its adverse credibility ruling. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 165-67. All but one of the bases for the credibility determination concern Ye's travel to the United States, and the agency did not address the reliability of the credible fear interview or otherwise explain how, viewing the totality of the circumstances, these discrepancies regarding his travel and the single inconsistency regarding whether Ye was burned or merely threatened with burning render the entirety of Ye's claim not credible. See Poradisova, 420 F.3d at 77. Ye also argues that the BIA erred by failing to consider whether he independently established a well-founded fear of future persecution and challenges the IJ's alternative non-credibility based rejection of his future persecution claim. But, because the credibility determination was the sole basis for the BIA's denial of relief, only the credibility determination is properly before us. Xue Hong Yang, 426 F.3d at 522. Had the adverse credibility determination been supported by substantial evidence, it would have applied to Ye's description of both his past and his current practice of Christianity, and would therefore have afforded a basis for denying Ye's claims based on both past and future persecution. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir. 2006).
For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA's order is VACATED, and case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).

United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.
Argued: October 17, 2017.
Decided: January 3, 2018.
Appeal and cross-appeal from the Sept. 28, 2016, judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Alvin K. Hellerstein, District Judge) requiring New York prison and parole officials to pay William Hassell, a former state prisoner, nominal damages plus attorney's fees for their unreasonable delay in requesting a New York trial court to resentence Hassell and impose a term of post-release supervision (""PRS"") after a term of PRS had been administratively imposed. Hassell's appeal seeks review of the District Court's ruling that the state officials were entitled to qualified immunity on Hassell's claim for additional damages for the period after a state court at resentencing imposed a term of PRS. The Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants Brian Fischer and Anthony J. Annucci, officials of the New York State Department of Corrections, and Andrea W. Evans and Terrence Tracy, officials of the New York State Board of Parole, all sued in their individual capacities, cross-appeal to seek review of the District Court's decision denying them judgment on the pleadings on the ground of qualified immunity for the six month period, prior to Hassell's resentencing, for which the District Court awarded Hassell nominal damages.
Affirmed as to the appeal; affirmed in part, vacated in part, as to the cross-appeal, and remanded.

Before: NEWMAN and CABRANES, Circuit Judges, and CHATIGNY,[2] District Judge.
JON O. NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.
In 1998, the New York legislature passed a sentencing reform statute that changed the sentencing scheme for violent felony offenders by eliminating parole and requiring a term of post-release supervision (""PRS"") to follow determinate sentences. See N.Y. Penal Law § 70.45(1); People v. Catu, 4 N.Y.3d 242, 244 (2005). However, section 70.45(1), as enacted, did not require state court judges to impose a term of PRS at sentencing. See Scott v. Fischer, 616 F.3d 100, 103 (2d Cir. 2010).[3] In the many cases where state court judges did not impose terms of PRS at sentencing, officials of the New York State Department of Corrections (""DOCS"") administratively imposed such terms. See Betances v. Fischer, 837 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2016) (""Betances II"").
In 2006, this Court ruled that DOCS officials violated ""the due process guarantees of the United States Constitution"" by administratively imposing PRS terms. See Earley v. Murray, 451 F.3d 71, 76 n.1 (2d Cir.) (""Earley I""), reh'g denied, 462 F.3d 147 (2d Cir. 2006) (""Earley II""). Earley I led to several individual prisoner lawsuits,[4] and a class action, see Betances v. Fischer, 304 F.R.D. 416, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (""Betances Class Op."") (certifying class),[5] seeking damages for the unconstitutional imposition of PRS terms or the delay in requesting state courts to resentence to add such terms. The pending appeal appears to be the first of these individual cases to reach this Court in which a judgment has been entered awarding damages to a prisoner.
Plaintiff-Appellant-Cross-Appellee William Hassell appeals from the September 28, 2016, judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Alvin K. Hellerstein, District Judge) entered against the Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants Brian Fischer, DOCS Commissioner, Anthony J. Annucci, Acting DOCS Commissioner, Andrea W. Evans, Chairwoman of the New York State Board of Parole, and Terrence Tracy, an employee of the Parole Board, all sued in their individual capacities. See Hassell v. Fischer, 96 F. Supp. 3d 370 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The judgment awarded Hassell nominal damages of $600, $100 for each of the six months during which the District Court ruled that the defendants had unreasonably delayed in requesting a state trial court to resentence him and impose a term of PRS after such a term had been administratively imposed. The judgment also awarded Hassell attorney's fees of $24,000.
Hassell's appeal seeks review of the District Court's ruling that the state officials were entitled to qualified immunity on Hassell's claim for additional damages for the period after a state court, at resentencing on December 3, 2008, imposed a term of PRS. The state officials' cross-appeal seeks review of the District Court's decision awarding Hassell nominal damages for the six-month period prior to Hassell's resentencing because of the officials' delay in making reasonably prompt efforts to notify the state court sentencing judge of the need to resentence Hassell and add a judicially imposed term of PRS.
On Hassell's appeal, we affirm. On the state officials' cross-appeal, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for entry of a revised judgment and consideration of whether attorney's fees should be adjusted in light of our disposition of the cross-appeal.
BACKGROUND
Hassell's sentencing, PRS, and resentencing. On November 21, 2002, Hassell received a sentence of three and one-half years, based on a guilty plea to a charge of assault in the second degree. The sentence was consecutive to a sentence Hassell was then serving for another offense. The state court judge did not impose the required PRS term to follow the second of Hassell's consecutive sentences.
At some point during Hassell's incarceration, DOCS officials administratively added a five-year PRS term to his sentence, and thereafter State Parole Board officials monitored his compliance with the conditions of that PRS term upon his release from prison.
The expiration date of the second of Hassell's consecutive sentences was August 31, 2008, but he was released from prison earlier on February 29, 2008, because he had earned good time credits equal to one-seventh of his sentence. Had there been no administratively imposed PRS term, Hassell would have been subject to a form of supervision called ""conditional release"" for the period that his confinement was shortened by good time credits. See N.Y. Correction Law § 803(1)(c); N.Y. Penal Law § 70.40(1)(b). However, as the New York Court of Appeals has explained, ""[A] defendant who is conditionally released immediately commences serving the imposed term of PRS and the remaining term of incarceration is `held in abeyance' during this period."" People v. Williams, 19 N.Y.3d 100, 104 (2012) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law § 70.45(5)(a)). In conformity with this explanation of New York law, the District Court stated that on the date of Hassell's release from confinement, February 29, 2008, he was subject to the PRS term of five years that had been administratively imposed.
On September 15, 2008, DOCS notified the New York County Supreme Court that had sentenced Hassell that he needed to be resentenced to add a term of PRS as part of his sentence. On December 3, 2008, Hassell was resentenced to his original sentence plus five years of PRS nunc pro tunc.
On June 17, 2010, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that Hassell's resentencing violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution because the resentencing added a sanction after his release from custody, see People v. Hassell, 14 N.Y.3d 925, 926 (2010), a period when ""a legitimate expectation in the finality of [his] sentence [had] arise[n],"" People v. Williams, 14 N.Y.3d 198, 217 (2010). Hassell's PRS was terminated that day.
Hassell's lawsuit. Hassell filed his initial complaint (later amended) in 2013, alleging that he was subjected to PRS in a manner that violated his due process and double jeopardy rights guaranteed by the Constitution. He sought monetary damages and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. Hassell alleged that the DOCS defendants administratively added a five-year PRS term to his sentence, and that they and the Parole Board defendants worked with and directed lower level DOCS and Parole Board employees to subject him to the conditions of the administratively imposed PRS term upon Hassell's release, violating his right to due process (the ""First Violation""). Hassell also alleged that he was subjected to double jeopardy when the defendants caused the sentencing court to resentence him and add a PRS term (the ""Second Violation"").
The defendants moved, pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the amended complaint on several grounds, including qualified immunity. In an order and opinion entered April 1, 2015 (""the April Opinion""), the District Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. See Hassell, 96 F. Supp. 3d at 374. On the First Violation-the administrative imposition and application of PRS conditions between Hassell's release from prison on February 29, and his resentencing on December 3, 2008-the Court denied the motion as to defendants Fischer, Annucci, Tracy, and Evans.[6] The Court ruled that they were not entitled to qualified immunity because they had violated clearly established law, announced in Earley I, when they administratively added and then applied the conditions of a PRS term to Hassell.[7] The District Court also ruled that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the defendants had taken reasonable steps to request the state court to resentence Hassell.[8]
On the Second Violation-the defendants' request to have the state court resentence Hassell with a PRS term and apply its conditions to him between December 3, 2008, the date of resentencing, and June 17, 2010, the date when PRS was terminated-the District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court ruled that they were entitled to qualified immunity because they had acted with objective reasonableness in requesting the state court to resentence Hassell.[9]
To determine the time period for which Hassell could receive damages for the First Violation, the District Court, in an order entered July 18, 2016 (""the July Order""), first established the maximum period for a potential recovery. That period, the Court ruled, began on February 29, 2008, the date Hassell became subject to administratively imposed PRS after his release from prison, and ended on December 3, 2008, the date the state court imposed a PRS term at resentencing.
Within that period of potential damages, the District Court then determined a period of actual damages through a reconstruction of what the Court ruled would have happened if the defendants had acted in a reasonably timely manner to request resentencing. First, the Court ruled that by April 15, 2008, 45 days after February 29, 2008, Annucci, Fischer, and Tracy ""should have caused a motion to be filed with Justice Uviller [the Judge who had sentenced Hassell], asking her to correct Hassell's sentence."" July Order at 3, Special Appx. (""SA"") 29. Then, Judge Hellerstein continued, by May 31, 2008, 45 days after April 15, 2008, the State Court ""should have acted."" Id. Finally, apparently recognizing that May 31 was a Saturday and that the next business day when the resentencing could have occurred was June 2, Judge Hellerstein ruled that the period of unreasonable delay started on the next day, June 3, 2008, and ran until December 3, 2008, when resentencing actually occurred. See id.
Having thus framed a six-month period of unreasonable delay, Judge Hellerstein then considered what damages were warranted for that delay. He observed that no matter when Justice Uviller resentenced Hassell, she would have imposed the same five-year term of PRS that she imposed on December 3, 2008, and done so nunc pro tunc. So even though Judge Hellerstein ruled that there had been an unreasonable delay in resentencing, he concluded that the delay ""would not have changed Hassell's life in the slightest."" Id. at 4, SA 30. For that reason Judge Hellerstein awarded only nominal damages of $100 per month for a total of $600.[10] To this sum, he added attorney's fees of $24,000, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. See Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney's Fees, SA 32.
DISCUSSION
I. This Court's PRS Decisions
Consideration of the issues raised by both Hassell's appeal and the defendants' cross-appeal requires familiarity with the sequence of decisions in this Court concerning administratively imposed PRS. In Earley I, decided in 2006, a prisoner then serving a state sentence that lacked a judicially imposed PRS term sought a writ of habeas corpus to obtain removal of the PRS term that had been administratively imposed by DOCS officials. We ruled that under clearly established Supreme Court precedent, see Hill v. United States ex rel. Wampler, 298 U.S. 460 (1936), the administrative imposition of PRS was invalid. See Earley I, 451 F.3d at 76. We did not grant relief, but remanded for determination of the timeliness of the habeas corpus petition because it was unclear whether it had been filed within one year of the time when the prisoner became aware of the imposition of PRS.[11]
On rehearing, we rejected the state officials' argument that, because ""New York law automatically includes a period of PRS in every determinate sentence,"" they were entitled to add PRS terms administratively. Earley II, 462 F.3d at 148. ""[T]he only sentence known to the law is the sentence imposed by the judge; any additional penalty added to that sentence by another authority is invalid, regardless of its source, origin, or authority until the judge personally amends the sentence."" Id. at 149.
In Rivers v. Fischer, 390 F. App'x 22 (2d Cir. 2010), we ruled that Earley I did not entitle a prisoner to be released from custody after violation of the conditions of a PRS term that had been administratively imposed. See id. at 24.
In Scott v. Fischer, 616 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 2000), a prisoner, subject to administratively imposed PRS after serving her sentence, sought damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because she had been arrested and incarcerated for violation of PRS conditions. Her damages suit followed the grant of a writ of habeas corpus that secured her release. Scott first noted that it was ""open to question"" whether Earley I had clearly established that administratively imposed PRS was unconstitutional, see Scott, 616 F.3d at 107, but that unconstitutionality had not been established before Earley I, see id. at 108. Scott then considered the plaintiff's claim that after Earley I, the defendants were liable for violating her due process rights by, among other things, not seeking to remove her PRS. Scott rejected the claim on the ground that the plaintiff had not pleaded sufficient facts ""giving rise to a clearly established affirmative legal obligation on the part of the DOC defendants to take any of the actions that [the plaintiff] alleges they failed to take."" Id. at 109.
Thus, Scott ruled that a duty to act had to be ""clearly established"" before liability could arise for failure to act, but concluded that the plaintiff had not pleaded facts to show that the requirement had been met.
In Joyner-El-Qawi-Bey v. Russi, 439 F. App'x 36 (2d Cir. 2011), we ruled that Earley I did not require state officials to remove a PRS term that had been administratively imposed.[12]
In Vincent v. Yelich, 718 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2013), eleven plaintiffs subject to administratively imposed PRS after serving their sentences sought damages under section 1983. Vincent first answered the question left open in Scott-when the right not to have PRS imposed administratively was clearly established-by stating that this occurred on June 9, 2006, when Earley I was decided. See id. at 160, 168. Then Vincent ruled that Earley I had given DOCS officials two alternatives: ""either to have [the plaintiffs] resentenced by the court for the imposition of PRS terms in a constitutional manner or to excise the PRS conditions from their records and relieve them of those conditions."" Id. at 172.
However, Vincent made clear that the first alternative, resentencing, was an available option only if DOCS officials acted with ""objective reasonableness,"" id. at 177, i.e., without unreasonable delay, to discharge the affirmative duty recognized in Scott to seek resentencing. Significant to our case, Vincent ruled that the first alternative was an option that DOCS officials could pursue even though those officials had imposed PRS administratively on the Vincent plaintiffs just as they had done with respect to Hassell.
Elaborating on the first alternative, Vincent explained that it was among the duties of Annucci, a defendant in the pending appeal, ""to seek a resolution of the PRS issues among DOCS, the prosecutors, and the courts by attempting, through direct or indirect communication with the courts, to have persons who should, under New York substantive law, have had PRS imposed as part of their sentences, resentenced by the court."" Id. at 173.
Vincent then noted that, after Earley I, Annucci had testified in a state trial court that ""DOCS conducted a study `to identify every individual in [DOCS's] custody who required PRS, but for whom the commitment was silent.'"" Id. at 174 (quoting State v. Myers, No. 4834-08, Sup. Ct. Albany County, N.Y., Hearing Transcript, June 6, 2008 (""Myers Tr.""), at 93) (alteration in original). Annucci also testified, ""`I began an initiative with the Office of Court Administration asking them going forward to put out an instruction to all judges in the State that the good practice would be whenever a determinate sentence of imprisonment was imposed, they should announce the period of post-release supervision on the record.'"" Id. (quoting Myers Tr. at 104) (emphases omitted).
Then, significant to the pending appeal, Vincent stated, ""It is possible that behind these statements may lie concrete evidence that could establish that Annucci made reasonable efforts either to seek resentencing of such persons or to end their unconstitutional imprisonment and excise PRS from their prison records."" Id. But because ""the record remain[ed] to be developed as to the objective reasonableness of Annucci's efforts,"" id. at 177, Vincent ""remanded for further proceedings,"" id. at 178.
Finally, and most relevant to the pending appeal, is Betances v. Fischer, 837 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2016) (""Betances II""), an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a defense of qualified immunity, see Salim v. Proulx, 93 F.3d 86, 90-91 (2d Cir. 1996).[13] Betances II was a class action brought by a class of prisoners ""who were sentenced to prison in New York State for a fixed term that did not include a term of PRS, but who were nevertheless subjected to PRS after the maximum expiration dates of their determinate sentences and after June 9, 2006."" Betances v. Fischer, 304 F.R.D. 416, 427 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (""Betances Class Op."") (certifying class).[14] The defendants, as in the pending appeal, were Fischer, Annucci, and Tracy. They contended that the steps they had taken after Earley I to identify prisoners who needed to be resentenced to add PRS terms and then to inform state courts of the need for resentencings satisfied the affirmative duty option that we had outlined in Vincent to comply with our ruling in Earley I.
Our Court disagreed. We relied primarily on the defendants' admissions in deposition testimony that they had decided not to implement Earley I for many months after that decision was rendered. Excerpts from those depositions are set out in the margin.[15] Their statements led us to conclude: ""In short, the three defendants decided not to comply with Earley I although they understood the meaning of its holding and that its holding applied to their departments."" Betances II, 837 F.3d at 168.
We acknowledged that resentencing prisoners subject to administratively imposed PRS terms ""presented practical difficulties."" Id. at 173. Ultimately, however, we ruled that the defendants ""did not make an objectively reasonabl[e] effort `to relieve [plaintiffs] of the burdens of those unlawfully imposed terms after [they] knew it had been ruled that the imposition violated federal law.'"" Id. at 174 (quoting Vincent, 718 F.3d at 177). As we pointed out, ""Each defendant testified that nothing prevented him from taking these steps back in 2006, and the logistical difficulties did not increase in the interim."" Id.
We therefore affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, which had rejected the defendants' defense of qualified immunity and held them personally liable. See id. at 170. That affirmance on the interlocutory appeal left the issue of damages for determination by the District Court.[16]
With this sequence of decisions in mind, we turn to the parties' specific claims on appeal.
II. Hassell's Appeal
Hassell's appeal challenges the District Court's decision not to award even nominal damages for his being subject to PRS during the period after his resentencing on December 3, 2008. His claim for such damages was properly determined by the District Court to be defeated by the defendants' defense of qualified immunity. Until the 2010 decision of the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Williams, 14 N.Y.3d 198 (2010), it was not clearly established that judicially imposed PRS upon released prisoners was unlawful. See King v. Cuomo, 465 F. App'x 42, 45 (2d Cir. 2012). Furthermore, the action of the state trial court in imposing PRS on Hassell was obviously an intervening cause of his post-resentencing PRS for which the defendants bore no responsibility.
III. The Defendants' Cross-Appeal
The defendants' cross-appeal challenges the District Court's rejection of their defense of qualified immunity and the Court's determination that subjecting Hassell to administratively imposed PRS violated his right to due process during the period from June 3, 2008, to December 3, 2008. They contend that they acted with objective reasonableness in responding to the Earley I decision, citing the same steps they relied on in the Betances litigation.[17] But those steps, set out in the margin,[18] were primarily taken between 14 and 19 months after the decision in Earley I, as we pointed out in Betances II, 837 F.3d at 172, and that decision has already determined that these steps were not an objectively reasonable justification for the defendants' delay in seeking resentencing of prisoners with administratively imposed PRS terms.[19] ""That the defendants eventually took reasonable steps to comply with Earley I cannot excuse their unreasonable delay in doing so."" Id.
Betances II is indistinguishable from Hassell's case. Like the plaintiffs in Betances II, Hassell is an offender ""subject to [a] mandatory PRS term[]"" after June 9, 2006, and who alleged that the term was imposed by ""DOCS, rather than [his] sentencing judge."" Id. at 170. Accordingly, the defendants are foreclosed by Betances II from arguing that their belated, albeit reasonable, steps to comply with Earley I excuse the initial unreasonable delay.
In addition to the steps that the defendants relied on in Betances II to comply with Earley I, they point out on this appeal that just two weeks after the expiration of Hassell's sentence on August 31, 2008, they notified Justice Uviller on September 15, 2008, of the need to resentence Hassell. That fact is irrelevant to the defendants' liability. As Betances II determined, their liability in that case arose from their unreasonable delay in acting to comply with Earley I for many months after that decision, and they are not absolved of that liability in this case by a step they took even more months later.
One aspect of the District Court's award of nominal damages for the period from June 3 to December 3, 2008, however, requires modification because of the following circumstances. Hassell's sentence terminated on August 31, 2008. Although he was subject to administratively imposed PRS from February 29,[20] when he was released from custody because of good time credits, until August 31, when his sentence terminated six months later, he would have been subject to conditional release during this time period had a PRS term not been imposed. Hassell has made no showing that the conditions of his PRS term were in any respect more onerous than those of conditional release would have been. Without any showing of an adverse consequence during the three months after June 3, Hassell has not suffered a denial of his due process rights during that period. Cf. United States v. Ray, 578 F.3d 184, 200 (2d Cir. 2009) (""To prove a due process violation as a result of a sentencing delay, the prejudice claimed by the defendant . . . must be substantial and demonstrable."").
Conclusion
On Hassell's appeal, we affirm; on the defendants' cross-appeal, we vacate the award of $300 in nominal damages for the three months after June 3, 2008; affirm the award of $300 in nominal damages for the three months after September 1, 2008; and remand for entry of a revised judgment and such reconsideration of the amount of attorney's fees as the District Court deems appropriate in light of our ruling on the defendants' cross-appeal.

Betances Class Op., 304 F.R.D. at 427. ""[E]nforcement"" in the class definition means being subjected to the conditions of PRS or returned to custody for violation of those conditions. See id. at 427 n.82.
[6]  The District Court later dismissed the complaint as to Evans on motion for summary judgment because Hassell had not proven that she was ""responsible for formulating [the Parole Board's] policy in response to Earley [I] or continuing the enforcement of administratively imposed PRS terms known to be invalid."" Special Appx. 28 n.1. However, the judgment states that Evans, along with the other three defendants, is obligated to pay nominal damages and attorney's fees. If, as seems likely, her inclusion was inadvertent, the judgment should be corrected on remand.
[7]  Qualified immunity ""shields government officials from civil liability `insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'"" Farid v. Ellen, 593 F.3d 233, 244 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). It ""gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions,"" thus ""protect[ing] `all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'"" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 743 (2011) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)).
[8]  The District Court dismissed the amended complaint on the ground of qualified immunity as to the lower level defendants, who were alleged to have applied, at the behest of Fischer, Annucci, Tracy, and Evans, the unlawful PRS conditions prior to Hassell's resentencing, ruling there was no allegation that they knew or should have known that the PRS term had been unlawfully imposed by senior DOCS officials. See Hassell, 96 F. Supp. 3d at 382-83.
[9]  The April Opinion also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss Hassell's state law claims, ruling that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over them because the state court itself lacked jurisdiction over them. See Hassell, 96 F. Supp. 3d at 385-86. (""[A] federal court cannot exercise jurisdiction over pendent state law claims over which a state court lacks jurisdiction.""). Hassell does not challenge the dismissal of these claims.
[10]  Although nominal damages are usually $1 (without cumulation for multiple months of a violation), see, e.g., Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla., 568 U.S. 115 (2013); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266-67 (1978), the defendants do not contend on this appeal that $100 per month is not an appropriate amount of nominal damages for any month of delay for which they are determined to be liable.
[11]  On remand of Earley I, the District Court stayed its order granting the habeas corpus petition to permit the New York state sentencing court an opportunity to correct ""a ministerial error that may be rectified easily,"" adding that the Court assumed that the corrected sentence would be imposed nunc pro tunc. See Earley v. Murray, No. 03-CV-3104, 2007 WL 1288031, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. May 1, 2007).
[12]  The holding of Joyner-El-Qawi-Bey is inferred from our affirmance of the District Court's decision for the reasons set forth in that decision, which explained the Court's rejection of the relief sought by the prisoner, see Joyner-El-Quwi-Bey v. Russi, No. 09-CV-2047, 2010 WL 1222804 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2010).
[13]  The Betances case was previously before our Court when we affirmed the District Court's denial of the defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity. See Betances v. Fischer, 519 F. App'x 39 (2d Cir. 2013) (""Betances I""). Betances I, filed the same day as Vincent v. Yelich, supra, considered the case indistinguishable from Vincent, i.e., that the issue of whether the defendants had acted without unreasonable delay in seeking resentencing remained to be determined by the District Court.
[14]  The District Court in Betances II, earlier in its opinion, described the class in slightly different language, see Betances Class Op., 304 F.R.D. at 21, but the differences have no bearing on any issue in this appeal. And, because the Defendants make no argument as to whether Hassell is a member of the class, we need not consider that possibility.
[15]  Annucci:
""Q. You made the decision not to take any action retroactively until further notice, right?
""A. Correct.
""Q. And you made the decision to take no action prospectively . . . to conform DOCS policy and conduct to the holding of Earley [I] as well, right?
. . .
""A. Correct.""
Betances II, 837 F.3d at 167.
Fischer:
""Q. But the decision to continue basically enforcing that policy [of administratively adding PRS to inmates' sentences] notwithstanding Earley [I], is it fair to characterize that as an operational decision?
""A. Yes.

Tracy:
""Q. But I am correct . . . your determination was to err on the side of continuing supervision and continuing incarceration until you could get those people back before courts; right?

""A. Yes. That's the decision that the agency arrived at, yes.""
Id. at 168.
[16]  This Court had stayed District Court proceedings pending disposition of the interlocutory appeal. See No. 15-2836, Dkt. No. 70 (Dec. 16, 2015).
[17]  The cross-appellants' account of their efforts to comply with Earley I are set out in Annucci's affirmation filed in State v. Myers, No. 4834-08, Sup. Ct. Albany County, N.Y., which is included in the Joint Appendix in this appeal, JA 267, 276-83, ¶¶ 36-59.
[18]  ""In either February or March 2007, . . . DOCS began to review its files to identify inmates whose sentences included PRS terms added by DOCS employees. . . . In April 2007, DOCS employees completed their initial review, which included over 40,000 inmate files. . . . By the middle of May 2008, DOCS launched a `Post-Release Supervision Resentencing Initiative' to obtain resentencing of individuals in its custody whose sentencing judges had not pronounced PRS terms required by § 70.45. . . . Finally, on June 4, 2008, DOCS and [the New York State Division of Parole] filed a declaratory judgment action in state court seeking judicial approval of a plan that would permit state agencies, district attorneys, and state courts to systematically identify and refer improperly sentenced inmates back to the sentencing courts to be resentenced."" Betances II, 837 F.3d at 169-70.
[19]  The cross-appellants press the limits of advocacy by stating that in Betances II ""this Court also recognized that by `late April and early May 2008,' defendants had undertaken `reasonable steps towards bringing DOCS . . . into compliance with Earley [I],'"" Brief for cross-appellants at 29 (quoting Betances II, 837 F.3d at 172) (ellipsis in original), while omitting the words that immediately follow the second quoted fragment, in which we stated that the steps taken ""had been unreasonably delayed,"" Betances II, 837 F.3d at 172.
[20]  As discussed above, the District Court calculated damages starting on the day after Hassell would have been resentenced had the defendants not unreasonably delayed in complying with Earley I (June 3, 2008), not the day Hassell was released from custody (February 29, 2008).

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Appeal from a judgment and post-judgment order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Seybert, J.), directing third-party garnishees to satisfy a creditor's judgment against a judgment debtor as damages for the garnishees' violation of certain restraining notices.
AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.

Before: LIVINGSTON, LYNCH, and CHIN, Circuit Judges.
CHIN, Circuit Judge.
Third-party garnishees appeal from a judgment of the district court (Seybert, J.) directing them to turn over $1,056,444.15 to a judgment creditor to satisfy a judgment against a judgment debtor. The district court awarded the sum as damages for the garnishees' violation of certain restraining notices. The garnishees also appeal from the district court's post-judgment order denying their motion to alter the judgment.
On appeal, the garnishees principally argue that (1) plaintiff was required to commence a special proceeding against garnishees under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (""C.P.L.R."") article 52, instead of proceeding by motion; (2) garnishees did not violate the restraining notices under C.P.L.R. § 5222(b); and (3) the district court erred in awarding damages and doing so without holding a hearing.
We affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff-counter-defendant-appellee CSX Transportation, Inc. (""CSX"") is an interstate rail carrier. Defendant-counter-claimant Emjay Environmental Recycling, Ltd. (""Emjay"") operates a waste transfer station. In 2012, appellant Island Rail Terminal, Inc. (""Island Rail"") purchased ""substantially all"" of Emjay's assets for $3,572,011.52 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement and Amended Promissory Note. Appellants Maggio Sanitation Services, Inc. (""Maggio"") and Eastern Resource Recycling, Inc. (""Eastern Resource"") guaranteed Island Rail's payment and performance obligations.
On September 25, 2014, the district court entered an amended judgment for CSX and against Emjay in this breach of contract suit for $1,056,444.15. We affirmed the judgment. CSX Transp., Inc. v. Emjay Envtl. Recycling, Ltd., 629 F. App'x 147 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order). By this point, at least three other creditors already held judgments against Emjay (based on unrelated claims): Environmental Logistics Services (""ELS"") for $1,238,807.03, Sullivan Gardner for $294,318.82, and Matthew Crescimanni (""Crescimanni"") for $402,013.83.
On November 12, 2014, CSX served third-party garnishees Island Rail, Maggio, and Eastern Resource (collectively, ""Garnishees"") with restraining notices (the ""Restraining Notices"") to aid its judgment entered in this case below.[1] The Restraining Notices prohibited Garnishees from ""mak[ing] or suffer[ing] any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any interference with"" and from ""otherwise dispos[ing] of any [] debt"" owed to Emjay, except as otherwise provided. N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5222(b); see also App. 99, 107, 115 (restraining notices). By this point, at least two creditors, Crescimanni and ELS, had already served writs of execution for their judgments against Emjay.[2]
Approximately three months later, on February 26, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Suffolk County, approved a consolidated $2.2 million settlement (the ""State Settlement Order"") in two unrelated actions involving Emjay, Garnishees, and several of Emjay's other creditors, including ELS, Sullivan Gardner, and Crescimanni.[3] CSX, after joining early settlement talks at the invitation of the parties in the state court proceedings, ultimately declined to participate. Under the terms of the settlement, Garnishees settled the claims asserted by Emjay for $2.2 million, which was then distributed to creditors ELS, Sullivan Gardner, and Crescimanni to satisfy their judgments against Emjay. The state court ""so ordered"" the settlement. App. 154.
On June 12, 2015, CSX filed a motion for a turnover order to compel Garnishees to satisfy CSX's September 25, 2014 amended judgment against Emjay, as entered by the district court in this case. In its motion, CSX also argued, alternatively, that Garnishees were liable to CSX for damages because entering into the state settlement violated the Restraining Notices. While the motion was pending, on June 24, 2015, Garnishees issued a check to CSX for $8,015.03 — the ""remainder of the proceeds of the settlement of the [Garnishees'] debt to Emjay pursuant to the"" State Settlement Order. App. 230-31. The remaining settlement payments to ELS, Sullivan Gardner and Crescimanni were paid out before this check was issued, but the dates of these payments do not appear to be included in the record. On or about July 9, 2015, CSX served writs of execution for its judgment.
On February 25, 2016, the district court granted CSX's motion for a turnover order and directed Garnishees to turn over $1,056,444.15 to CSX. The district court also held that ""to the extent that the Garnishees already made disbursements under the [State] Settlement Order, CSX is entitled to damages in the amount of the Judgment: $1,056,444.15."" Sp. App. 12. As to damages, the court explained that the Garnishees ""acted negligently by ignoring the Restraining Notices because only an order from this Court could alter the Garnishees' obligations."" Sp. App. 13. If Garnishees had not violated the Restraining Notices by paying out the $2.2 million state settlement, the district court concluded, the Garnishees would still have had $1,056,444.15 available, the amount of CSX's unsatisfied judgment.
On March 2, 2016, CSX moved the court to enter judgment against Garnishees on the ground that Garnishees already disbursed funds pursuant to the state settlement. On March 10, 2016, Garnishees moved for reconsideration of the district court's February 25, 2016 turnover order. In their motion, Garnishees objected to the district court's failure to hold a hearing and also requested oral argument on their motion.
On November 2, 2016, without holding oral argument or providing a hearing, the district court denied Garnishees' motion for reconsideration and granted CSX's motion to enter judgment against Garnishees, reaffirming that Garnishees would have been able to satisfy CSX's judgment of $1,056,444.15 if Garnishees had not violated the Restraining Notices by distributing funds pursuant to the $2.2 million state settlement. Although the court's initial order rested on the mistaken premise that the settlement funds were still available at the time of judgment, the court clarified that its ""ultimate conclusion rested on a damages analysis,"" Sp. App. 25, not a turnover analysis, and that Garnishees remained liable. As to damages, the court recognized that the Restraining Notices did not grant priority and agreed that priority creditors should be paid first. Based on the information before it, the court concluded that only Crescimanni's property execution granted him a superior right over CSX, and that offsetting Crescimanni's judgment of $402,013.83 still would have left sufficient funds for Garnishees to satisfy CSX's judgment. Finally, the court concluded that Garnishees ""have not raised any issues of fact"" and thus it ""need not hold a hearing to determine the proper judgment amount."" Sp. App. 33. The Second Amended Judgment was issued on November 8, 2016, and awarded CSX damages in the amount of $1,056,444.15 against Garnishees.
On November 4, 2016, Garnishees moved by letter to alter the judgment on two grounds, which they contended would reduce the judgment to $201,945.11. On December 1, 2016, the district court issued an order electronically denying Garnishees' motion. First, the district court declined to consider new evidence demonstrating that ELS served its property execution several months earlier — thereby granting it priority before the State Settlement Order — because Garnishees failed to show that they were ""justifiably ignorant"" of the evidence ""despite due diligence."" Elec. Order Den. Mot. to Alter J., CSX Transp. v. Island Rail Terminal, Inc., No. 12-cv-1865 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2016) (quoting Becnel v. Deutsche Bank AG, 838 F. Supp. 2d 168, 171 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)). Second, the district court concluded that accounting for statutory interest, which it omitted in its initial damages calculations, would not have affected its ultimate conclusion that Garnishees had sufficient funds to satisfy CSX's judgment.
This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
We review a district court's ruling on a request for an order of attachment for abuse of discretion. Exp.-Imp. Bank of the Republic of China v. Grenada, 768 F.3d 75, 84-85 (2d Cir. 2014). We also review a district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v. Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2000). ""The district court abuses its discretion if it applies legal standards incorrectly, relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, or proceeds on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law."" Aurelius Capital Partners, LP v. Republic of Argentina, 584 F.3d 120, 129 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). We review de novo a district court's interpretation of questions of New York law. See Tire Eng'g & Distrib. L.L.C. v. Bank of China Ltd., 740 F.3d 108, 113-14 (2d Cir. 2014).
Because the district court indicated that its ""ultimate conclusion rested on a damages analysis,"" Sp. App. 25, not a turnover analysis, we confine the scope of our review to the damages theory. Three principal issues are presented. First, Garnishees argue that CSX improperly proceeded by motion under Rule 69(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that, instead, CSX should have instituted a special proceeding against Garnishees pursuant to C.P.L.R. article 52 for the district court to obtain personal jurisdiction. Second, Garnishees argue that they did not violate the Restraining Notices because they transferred funds pursuant to an order of the state court, and C.P.L.R. § 5222(b) permits transfers ""pursuant to an order of the court."" Third, Garnishees contend that even if they did violate the Restraining Notices, the district court erred in concluding that CSX suffered damages when CSX was the creditor ""last in line,"" Appellants' Br. 29, and in failing to hold a hearing before fixing the amount of damages.[4]
I. Procedure for Enforcing Money Judgments
First, we agree with the district court that CSX was permitted to seek relief from Garnishees by motion under Rule 69(a), rather than by instituting a special proceeding pursuant to New York law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a).
A. Applicable Law
A motion to enforce a money judgment is governed by Rule 69(a), which provides that ""proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution . . . must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located."" Id. In New York, C.P.L.R. article 52 governs the enforcement and collection of money judgments. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. §§ 5201-5252. Section 5225(b) enables a judgment creditor to commence a ""special proceeding"" against a third party who ""is in possession or custody of money or other personal property"" in which the judgment debtor has an interest. Id. § 5225(b).[5] Section 5227 allows a judgment creditor to commence a special proceeding against a third party ""who it is shown is or will become indebted to the judgment debtor."" Id. § 5227.[6] Violation of a restraining notice subjects a garnishee to personal liability in a special proceeding under C.P.L.R. article 52 or a separate plenary action. Cruz v. TD Bank, N.A., 22 N.Y.3d 61, 77-78 (2013). C.P.L.R. article 4 sets forth the procedure for special proceedings. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. §§ 401-411.
B. Application
Although we have assumed in prior cases that parties may seek turnover orders by motion, we have not squarely addressed the issue. See, e.g., Vera v. Republic of Cuba, 802 F.3d 242, 244 n.3 (2d Cir. 2015); HBE Leasing Corp. v. Frank, 48 F.3d 623, 633 & n.7 (2d Cir. 1995).[7] We now hold that a party seeking a money judgment against a non-party garnishee may proceed by motion and need not commence a special proceeding, as long as the court has personal jurisdiction over the garnishee. We reach this conclusion for three reasons.
First, a special proceeding is a procedural vehicle under New York law with no equivalent under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which recognize only ""one form of action — the civil action."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 2; see Mitchell v. Garrison Prot. Servs., Inc., 819 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2016) (per curiam). It is therefore ""unclear"" how a party in a federal district court in New York could comply with the special proceeding requirements, Mitchell, 819 F.3d at 640, which we have indicated ""need not be strictly adhered to as long as there is no prejudice to the opposing party in giving notice of the claims and framing the issues,"" Vera, 802 F.3d at 244 n.3.
Second, a special proceeding is more akin to motion practice than a plenary action. See HBE Leasing Corp., 48 F.3d at 633 (summary relief available in a special proceeding under C.P.L.R. article 52); O'Brien-Kreitzberg & Assocs. v. K.P., Inc., 630 N.Y.S.2d 76, 76 (1st Dep't 1995) (action seeking to enforce a money judgment is ""more appropriately obtained in a supplementary special proceeding pursuant to [C.P.L.R.] article 52 rather than a plenary action"" (citation omitted)). See generally C.P.L.R. § 401, cmt. 401:1 (practice commentary) (""Like an action, [a special proceeding] ends in a judgment [], but the procedure is similar to that on a motion []. Speed, economy and efficiency are the hallmarks of this procedure.""); David D. Siegel, New York Practice § 547 (5th ed. 2017) (""A special proceeding is. . . . as plenary as an action, culminating in a judgment, but is brought on with the ease, speed, and economy of a mere motion."").
Third, New York law explicitly contemplates that proceedings brought as motions may, if necessary, be converted to special proceedings by the court. Under C.P.L.R. § 103(c), ""[i]f a court has obtained jurisdiction over the parties, a civil judicial proceeding shall not be dismissed solely because it is not brought in the proper form. . . . If the court finds it appropriate in the interests of justice, it may convert a motion into a special proceeding. . . ."" See also Jackson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 53 N.Y.S.3d 71, 74-75 (2d Dep't 2017) (citing C.P.L.R. § 103(c) and refusing to dismiss an action for failure to commence a special proceeding under article 52, even where that provision provided the exclusive remedy). The court must, however, have personal jurisdiction over the parties. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 103(c); Commonwealth of N. Mariana Islands v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 21 N.Y.3d 55, 64 (2013) (""[P]ersonal jurisdiction is the linchpin of authority under section 5225(b)."").
Accordingly, we conclude that CSX was not required to institute a separate proceeding against Garnishees and could proceed by motion under Rule 69(a), so long as the district court otherwise had personal jurisdiction over Garnishees. Here, personal jurisdiction is clear: Garnishees do not contest that they are New York corporations with their principal places of business in the Eastern District of New York. Although Garnishees contend that no summons was served, the record reflects that CSX complied with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by serving the summons on Cathy McByrne, a person authorized to accept service on behalf of Vincent Maggio, Jr., Chief Executive Officer for Garnishees. We therefore conclude that the district court properly allowed CSX to proceed by motion.
II. Statutory Construction of C.P.L.R. § 5222
Second, Garnishees argue that they did not violate the Restraining Notices because they transferred the restrained funds pursuant to the state court's settlement order, and C.P.L.R. § 5222(b) authorizes disbursements ""pursuant to an order of the court."" We agree with the district court that the plain meaning of the statute does not support Garnishees' interpretation.
A. Applicable Law
Under C.P.L.R. § 5222, an attorney for the judgment creditor may, as an officer of the court, serve a restraining notice on a third party who ""owes a debt to the judgment debtor or . . . is in the possession or custody of property in which he or she knows or has reason to believe the judgment debtor . . . has an interest."" N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5222(a)-(b). A party subject to a restraining notice is ""forbidden to make or suffer any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any interference with, any such property, or pay over or otherwise dispose of any such debt . . . except upon direction of the sheriff or pursuant to an order of the court. . . ."" Id. § 5222(b) (emphasis added). A court has broad authority to regulate the use of enforcement devices. Id. § 5240 (""The court may at any time, on its own initiative or the motion of any interested person, and upon such notice as it may require, make an order denying, limiting, conditioning, regulating, extending or modifying the use of any enforcement procedure."").
B. Application
""In determining the law of the State of New York, `we will consider not only state statutes but also state decisional law.'"" Elliott Assocs., L.P. v. Banco de la Nacion, 194 F.3d 363, 370 (2d Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). Here, the parties have not cited and we are unaware of any New York cases that precisely address the issue before us, so ""we will carefully predict how the highest court of the state would resolve the uncertainty or ambiguity"" by ""consider[ing] all of the resources to which the highest court of the state could look."" Id. (citations omitted). We begin by examining the text of the statute to discern whether it has a plain and unambiguous meaning. Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 108 (2d Cir. 2012); see also Elliott, 194 F.3d at 371 (noting that we ""look first to the plain language of a statute and interpret it by its ordinary, common meaning"" when interpreting a New York statute (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The meaning of a statute can be understood ""in context with and by reference to the whole statutory scheme, by appreciating how sections relate to one another."" Auburn Hous. Auth. v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138, 144 (2d Cir. 2002). ""A statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids absurd results."" United States v. Venturella, 391 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Dauray, 215 F.3d 257, 264 (2d Cir. 2000)).
Here, the plain and unambiguous meaning of C.P.L.R. § 5222(b) is that ""the"" court refers to the court out of which the restraining notice issued. The use of the definite article ""the"" indicates a singular court, whereas the indefinite article ""any"" or ""a"" denotes multiple courts. See Nat'l Foods, Inc. v. Rubin, 936 F.2d 656, 660 (2d Cir. 1991) (""[a]bsent some reason to conclude otherwise . . . `the court' referred to the second time . . . should be the same one referred to the first time — a `court of competent jurisdiction'""); see also Renz v. Grey Advert., Inc., 135 F.3d 217, 222 (2d Cir. 1997) (""Placing the article `the' in front of a word connotes the singularity of the word modified. . . . In contrast, the use of the indefinite article `a' implies that the modified noun is but one of several of that kind."").
In addition, as the district court explained, permitting a second court to dissolve a restraining notice issued out of the first court would injure the rights of creditors and threaten the first court's injunctive power. See Nardone v. Long Island Tr. Co., 336 N.Y.S.2d 325, 327 (2d Dep't 1972) (recognizing that a stay contained in an ex parte order ""did not serve to suspend the effectiveness of the restraining notice""; ""otherwise, any judgment debtor could obtain such an order, without notice to the court that a restraining notice had been served, or to the judgment creditor, and recover his property theretofore properly made the subject of the restraining notice""); see also Sumitomo Shoji New York, Inc. v. Chem. Bank N.Y. Tr. Co., 263 N.Y.S.2d 354, 358-59 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1965), aff'd, 267 N.Y.S.2d 477 (1st Dep't 1966) (discussing legislative history of C.P.L.R. § 5222 as favorable to judgment creditors in light of governor's veto of an amendment that would ""unnecessarily hamper judgment creditors in the collection of their judgments""). We therefore agree with the district court that the phrase ""an order of the court"" in C.P.L.R. § 5222(b) refers only to the court out of which the restraining notice issued. Although Garnishees contend that our reading undermines the broad authority conferred on New York courts by C.P.L.R. § 5240, there is no suggestion that the state court, in ""so ordering"" the settlement, intended to lift the Restraining Notices issued out of the federal district court. Indeed, the State Settlement Order does not mention CSX, let alone the Restraining Notices. The order therefore did not dissolve Garnishees' obligations under the Restraining Notices.
We also agree with the district court that Garnishees negligently violated the Restraining Notices. The Restraining Notices ""serve[d] as a type of injunction prohibiting the transfer of the judgment debtor's property."" Aspen Indus., Inc. v. Marine Midland Bank, 52 N.Y.2d 575, 579 (1981). After Garnishees were served with the Restraining Notices, they were ""forbidden to make or suffer any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any interference with, any such property"" in which the judgment debtor Emjay is known or believed to have an interest. N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5222(b). Garnishees were properly served with the Restraining Notices on November 12, 2014, and the Restraining Notices' injunctive effect was still in place on February 26, 2015, when Garnishees agreed to pay $2.2 million on behalf of Emjay to settle Emjay's debts to ELS, Sullivan Gardner, and Crescimanni in the State Settlement Order. The Garnishees do not dispute that Emjay clearly had an interest in the $2.2 million that Garnishees paid on Emjay's behalf in that settlement. See Ray v. Jama Prods., Inc., 425 N.Y.S.2d 630, 631 (2d Dep't 1980) (""The fact that a judgment debtor will directly benefit from the payment [to satisfy the judgment debtor's debts] is sufficient to require the party served with the restraining notice to comply with the provisions or be subject to the appropriate legal sanctions.""). In such circumstances, while Garnishees were entitled to contest the validity of the district court's Turnover Order, they were not free to simply ignore the injunctive effect of the Restraining Notices. See Sykes v. Bank of Am., 723 F.3d 399, 406 (2d Cir. 2013) (""A garnishee has no discretion to ignore a restraining notice that is valid on its face . . . even if it questions the legal foundation on which the notice is based.""). Garnishees plainly violated the Restraining Notices in doing so.
III. Damages
Third, Garnishees argue that even if they did violate the Restraining Notices, CSX is not entitled to recover because CSX sustained no damages as the creditor ""last in line"" under New York law on priority of judgments. Appellants' Br. 29. Relatedly, Garnishees contend that the district court erred by failing to hold a hearing, entertain testimony, or receive admissible evidence before holding them liable for CSX's unpaid judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing to resolve factual issues concerning the relative priorities of judgment creditors — a necessary predicate to determining the proper amount of damages, if any, sustained by CSX.
A. Applicable Law
A garnishee that violates a restraining notice may be liable to an aggrieved judgment creditor if the creditor establishes that ""it sustained damages as a result of the garnishee's disobedience of the [restraining] notice."" Aspen Indus., 52 N.Y.2d at 581. To establish damages, a creditor must ""demonstrate that property of the judgment debtor was available to satisfy the judgment at the time the restraining notice was in effect."" Id.; see also Nardone, 336 N.Y.S.2d at 327 (damages for violating a restraining notice are ""the amount of the judgment remaining unsatisfied, but limited to the amount in the account which would have been available to satisfy the judgment""). In Aspen, for instance, a judgment creditor could not establish damages resulting from a garnishee bank's violation of restraining notices, because the garnishee bank had a superior right of setoff to any debt owed to it by the judgment debtor based on section 151 of the Debtor and Creditor law. 52 N.Y.2d at 581-82.
New York has a comprehensive statutory scheme establishing priorities for directing the assets of a judgment debtor to competing judgment creditors. Under C.P.L.R. § 5234, ""the order of priority among judgments is to be determined strictly in accordance with the chronological service of execution levies and the filing of orders for turnover."" City of New York v. Panzirer, 259 N.Y.S.2d 284, 286 (1st Dep't 1965) (citing N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5234(c)). ""The mere service of restraining notices under [§] 5222 . . . does not invoke standing in the ranking of priorities."" Id.; Aspen Indus., 52 N.Y.2d at 579-80. Instead, a judgment creditor must take additional steps — such as securing a turnover order or an execution levy — to prevent intervening parties from attaining higher priority. See Aspen Indus., 52 N.Y.2d at 580.
A court ""may grant summary relief where there are no questions of fact, but `it must conduct a trial on disputed issues of fact on adverse claims in a turnover matter.'"" HBE Leasing Corp. v. Frank, 48 F.3d 623, 633 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Norstar Bank of Hudson Valley, 549 N.Y.S.2d 862, 863 (3d Dep't 1989)); see also Port of New York Auth. v. 62 Cortlandt St. Realty Co., 18 N.Y.2d 250, 255 (1966) (standards of summary judgment apply to special proceedings); Gonzalez v. City of New York, 8 N.Y.S.3d 290, 291 (1st Dep't 2015) (""It is settled that a special proceeding is subject to the same standards and rules of decision as apply on a motion for summary judgment, requiring the court to decide the matter `upon the pleadings, papers and admissions to the extent that no triable issues of fact are raised.'"" (citations omitted)). In general, a hearing is required to fix damages where it is unclear what amount in a garnishee's possession is the property of the judgment debtor and available to satisfy the judgment. See Nardone, 336 N.Y.S.2d at 327. Absent a factual issue concerning damages, however, a hearing is not required. See, e.g., Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 549 N.Y.S.2d at 863 (""Although a court may grant summary relief where there are no questions of fact in a special proceeding, it must conduct a trial on disputed issues of fact on adverse claims in a turnover matter."" (citing N.Y. C.P.L.R. §§ 409(b), 5225(b), 5239)); Michigan Assocs. v. Emigrant Sav. Bank, 345 N.Y.S.2d 329, 336 (Civ. Ct. 1973) (determining damages without any hearing because ""there is no issue of fact concerning damages"").
B. Application
To recover damages for Garnishees' violation of the Restraining Notices, CSX had to demonstrate that the ""property of the judgment debtor [Emjay] was available to satisfy the judgment at the time the restraining notice was in effect."" Aspen Indus., 52 N.Y.2d at 581. In other words, CSX had to demonstrate that Garnishees' debt to Emjay was available to satisfy CSX's judgment. Garnishees' debt to Emjay, in turn, had to be assessed in light of the priority of Emjay's various creditors pursuant to C.P.L.R. § 5234 — because if other creditors had superior claims to the restrained funds before Garnishees violated the Restraining Notices, then CSX did not suffer damages.
Here, the district court recognized that the Restraining Notices did not confer priority and that priority creditors were entitled to be paid first. After reviewing the timeline of judgments and executions, the district court concluded that only Crescimanni served an execution before the state court's February 26, 2015 settlement order that ""grant[ed] him a superior right."" Sp. App. 28. Therefore, the district court found, ""even if the Court preserved the $2.2 million settlement figure and offset Crescimanni's $402,013.83 judgment, the Garnishees would have had $1,797,986.17 left over to satisfy CSX's $1,056,444.15 judgment."" Sp. App. 27. The district court concluded that ""Garnishees have not raised any issues of fact"" and that it ""need not hold a hearing to determine the proper judgment amount."" Sp. App. 33. The district court subsequently declined in its discretion to recognize new evidence from Garnishees demonstrating that ELS had actually served its execution on November 5, 2014 — not March 10, 2015 — thereby also granting ELS higher priority.
We conclude that, at a minimum, the parties' submissions and the record demonstrate a lack of clarity as to the order of priority of judgment creditors, precluding the district court's grant of summary relief to CSX.
At the time of judgment, the order of priority was unclear. The record shows that, during state court proceedings on February 24, 2015, the participating judgment creditors — including Crescimanni, ELS and Sullivan Gardner — indicated that they believed, ""[w]ithout fixing the priorities in any way between us, we all had a higher priority than CSX."" App. 190. CSX's counsel was informed of the competing judgment creditors' views as to priority. Id. at 191. On June 26, 2015, Garnishees alleged in their opposition to CSX's turnover motion that ""aother than serving its Restraining Notices, CSX did nothing to enforce its judgment and, unlike Emjay's other creditors whose claims have a priority position, took no steps whatsoever to create or perfect an enforceable lien."" Id. at 125. On the other hand, CSX never asserted that it had a higher priority than any of the other creditors, and in fact even now suggests that priority is not relevant to damages. We reject CSX's argument because, as noted above, damages cannot be assessed without delineating the relative priority of judgment creditors.
The district court did not consider priorities when it invited CSX to apply for a judgment for damages in its initial turnover order. It did correctly recognize the importance of priority in its subsequent order denying Garnishees' motion for reconsideration. But the district court's final reasoning suggests that, had it possessed a complete picture of the relevant players and priorities before judgment, it might have reached a different outcome. And while the district court rejected as untimely Garnishees' submission regarding the correct date of ELS's execution, a hearing would have given Garnishees the opportunity to present this evidence.
Failure to resolve these factual issues before summarily awarding damages to CSX was an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we vacate that portion of the district court's judgment and orders holding CSX liable for $1,056,444.15 in damages, and remand with instructions for the district court to hold a hearing to resolve factual issues concerning damages including, but not limited to, the order of priority of judgment creditors. During the hearing, the district court should, at minimum, revisit the two factual issues that Garnishees raised in their letter motion to alter the judgment.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM IN PART, VACATE IN PART, and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
[1]  ""A `garnishee' is a person who owes a debt to a judgment debtor, or a person other than the judgment debtor who has property in his possession or custody in which a judgment debtor has an interest."" N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 105(i). A restraining notice is an enforcement device used in aid of an existing judgment that bears the caption of the underlying action. N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5222, cmt. 5222:1 (practice commentary). It may be issued by the judgment creditor's attorney against the judgment debtor or a third party. Id. A restraining notice served upon a garnishee ""serves as a type of injunction prohibiting the transfer of the judgment debtor's property."" Aspen Indus., Inc. v. Marine Midland Bank, 52 N.Y.2d 575, 579 (1981); see also N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 5222, cmt. 5222:1 (practice commentary) (""With ordinary money judgments, it is usually the attorney who issues the restraining notice, acting as an officer of the court in so doing. In that instance, the restraint results without a court order or any other preliminary judicial authorization. It is a rare example of an injunction, complete with contempt punishment as its sanction, not embodied in a court order or judgment."").
[2]  Garnishees belatedly corrected the date of ELS's writ of execution from March 10, 2015 to November 5, 2014 in a letter motion to alter the judgment. Letter Mot. to Alter J. 1, CSX Transp. v. Island Rail Terminal, Inc., No. 12-cv-1865 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 2016), ECF No. 100. As discussed further below, the district court declined in its discretion to consider the new fact. Elec. Order Den. Letter Mot. to Alter J., CSX Transp. v. Island Rail Terminal, Inc., No. 12-cv-1865 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2016).
[3]  In the first of those actions, Emjay sued Garnishees to recover the $3.5 million purchase price from the asset sale, and Garnishees raised various counter-claims. In the second, ELS, Sullivan Gardner, and Crescimanni sued Emjay for unpaid judgments.
[4]  CSX suggests that Garnishees' appeal is limited to the denial of the motion for reconsideration. But Garnishees' Amended Notice of Appeal identifies the initial turnover order, the order denying their motion for reconsideration, the Second Amended Judgment, as well as the district court's post-judgment order denying their motion to alter the judgment. CSX offers no argument for limiting the scope of our review to the single order denying the motion for reconsideration. We therefore consider and resolve Garnishees' appeal of all relevant orders in this dispute.
[5]  Section 5225(b) provides in pertinent part:
Upon a special proceeding commenced by the judgment creditor, against a person in possession or custody of money or other personal property in which the judgment debtor has an interest, or against a person who is a transferee of money or other personal property from the judgment debtor, where it is shown that the judgment debtor is entitled to the possession of such property or that the judgment creditor's rights to the property are superior to those of the transferee, the court shall require such person to pay the money. . . .
[6]  Section 5227 provides in pertinent part:
Upon a special proceeding commenced by the judgment creditor, against any person who it is shown is or will become indebted to the judgment debtor, the court may require such person to pay to the judgment creditor the debt upon maturity, or so much of it as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and to execute and deliver any document necessary to effect payment; or it may direct that a judgment be entered against such person in favor of the judgment creditor.
[7]  District courts in this circuit have also consistently allowed parties to request turnover orders by motion rather than by special proceeding. See, e.g., Bernard v. Lombardo, 2016 WL 7377240, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2016); Gen. Elec. Capital Corp. v. E. Bus. Sys., 2016 WL 3582061, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 28, 2016); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

Dec. 26, 2013); N. Mariana Islands v. Millard, 845 F. Supp. 2d 579, 581-82 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); JW Oilfield Equip., LLC v. Commerzbank, AG, 764 F. Supp. 2d 587, 591 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); Mitchell v. Lyons Prof'l Servs., Inc., 727 F. Supp. 2d 120, 122-23 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). But see Wasserman Media Grp., LLC v. Bender, 2012 WL 1506181, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (""[P]etitioner's motion for a turnover order in the instant action is procedurally defective. . . . If petitioner seeks a turnover order, it must bring a separate action. . . .""); Runaway Dev. Grp. v. Pentagen Techs. Int'l Ltd., 396 F. Supp. 2d 471, 473-74 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (same).

Argued: March 15, 2017.
Decided: January 12, 2018.
Defendants-Appellants Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Lloyd Blankfein, David A. Viniar, and Gary D. Cohn, appeal from a September 24, 2015 order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Crotty, J.), certifying a class of plaintiffs who purchased shares of common stock in Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., between 2007 and 2010. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants made material misstatements about Goldman's efforts to avoid conflicts of interest, and that those misstatements caused the value of their shares to decline. To establish the predominance of class-wide issues under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), plaintiffs invoked the rebuttable presumption of reliance established in Basic Inc. v.

Investors in a securities fraud class action traditionally have a problem proving that ""questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over . . . questions affecting only individual members"" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The presumption established in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988), addressed that problem by allowing courts to presume that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material information—including misrepresentations—and that investors rely on the integrity of the market price when they choose to buy or sell stock. Basic also established, however, that defendants may rebut the presumption, and therefore defeat class certification, by showing the misrepresentations did not actually affect the price of the stock. The question presented in this case is what defendants must do to meet that burden.
In light of this Court's recent pronouncement that defendants bear the burden of persuasion to rebut the Basic presumption by a preponderance of the evidence, see Waggoner v. Barclays PLC, 875 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2017), and for the additional reasons stated herein, we VACATE the September 24, 2015 Order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Crotty, J.) granting plaintiff's motion for class certification and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs-appellees acquired shares of common stock in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (""Goldman"") between February 5, 2007 and June 10, 2010. In July 2011, they commenced a securities fraud action in the District Court against Goldman and several of its directors (collectively, ""defendants""), for violating section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. See 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
I. Plaintiffs' Allegations of Fraud
In their consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs alleged that defendants made material misstatements about Goldman's efforts to avoid conflicts of interest, causing the value of their stock to decline.[1] Specifically, they alleged that defendants made the following statements in Goldman's Form 10-K filings and Annual Report, as well as in shareholder conference calls:
Our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have expanded the scope of our business and our client base, we increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own proprietary investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interest of another client. . . .
We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest. . . .
Our clients' interests always come first. Our experience shows that if we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. . . .
We are dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Our continued success depends upon unswerving adherence to this standard. . . .
Most importantly, and the basic reason for our success, is our extraordinary focus on our clients. . . .
Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business. . . .
Joint App'x 81-87.
Plaintiffs claimed that these statements about Goldman's efforts to avoid conflicts of interest were false and misleading because Goldman acted in direct conflict with the interests of its clients in at least four collateralized debt obligation (""CDO"") transactions involving subprime mortgages between 2006 and 2007, most notably the Abacus 2007 AC-1 (""Abacus"") transaction involving hedge-fund client Paulson & Co. Plaintiffs alleged that Goldman permitted Paulson, its client, to play an active role in the asset selection process for Abacus, without revealing to institutional investors that Paulson held the sole short position and thus chose particularly risky mortgages that it hoped ""would perform poorly or fail."" Plaintiffs claimed that Goldman's role in Abacus, which ultimately resulted in a $550 million settlement with the SEC, ""allow[ed] a favored client to benefit at the expense of Goldman's other clients,"" creating a conflict of interest at odds with the company's public statements.
The complaint asserted that Goldman created similar conflicts of interest in three other CDO transactions involving subprime mortgages: Hudson Mezzanine Funding 2006-1 (""Hudson""), Anderson Mezzanine Funding 2007-1 (""Anderson""), and Timberwolf I (""Timberwolf""). Goldman allegedly contributed equity to the portfolios in those transactions and told investors it was ""aligned"" with them, while simultaneously holding substantial short positions opposite their investments.
Although plaintiffs invested in Goldman—but not any of the CDOs described above—they claimed Goldman's conflicted roles in the transactions revealed that the company did not have ""extensive procedures and controls . . . designed to identify and address conflicts of interest"" and that it was not ""dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the laws,"" as its public statements had suggested.
Plaintiffs alleged that news of government enforcement actions against Goldman on three occasions in mid-2010 revealed the falsity of defendants' statements and caused the company's share prices to decline. On April 16, 2010, the SEC filed a securities fraud action against Goldman and one of its employees regarding the Abacus transaction, for failing to disclose to potential investors that Paulson played a significant role in the asset selection process. Following the announcement, the company's stock price declined 13% from $184.27 to $160.70 per share on April 16, 2010. On April 30, 2010, the company's share price dropped another 9% from $160.24 to $145.20 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman was under investigation by the Department of Justice for its purported role in the CDOs. And on June 10, 2010, the press reported that the SEC was investigating Goldman's conduct in the Hudson CDO, which resulted in a further 2% decline in the price of Goldman stock.[2]
According to plaintiffs, these three ""corrective disclosures""[3] revealed to the market the falsity of defendants' statements regarding Goldman's efforts to avoid conflicts of interest. Plaintiffs claimed that, on April 16, April 30, and June 10, 2010, the market learned for the first time that Goldman had created ""clear conflicts of interest with its own clients"" by ""intentionally packag[ing] and s[elling] . . . securities that were designed to fail, while at the same time reaping billions for itself or its favored clients by taking massive short positions"" in the same transactions. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants made the misstatements with the intent to defraud Goldman's shareholders, and that they lost, in total, over $13 billion as a result of defendants' fraud.
Defendants initially moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6), arguing the alleged misstatements were too general and vague to be actionable as a matter of law. The District Court denied defendants' motion, holding that plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded all six elements of a securities fraud action.[4] See Richman, 868 F. Supp. 2d at 271-72, 279. The District Court subsequently denied defendants' motions for reconsideration and interlocutory appeal. In re Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 10 Civ. 3461, 2014 WL 2815571, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2014); In re Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 10 Civ. 3461, 2014 WL 5002090, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 2014).
II. Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification
Plaintiffs then moved to certify a class consisting of ""[a]ll persons or entities who, between February 5, 2007 and June 10, 2010, purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. . . . and were damaged thereby."" Plaintiffs argued (and defendants did not dispute) that they satisfied the requirements for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): The class was sufficiently numerous, there were common issues of law or fact, the claims of the representative parties were typical of the claims of the class, and the representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
Plaintiffs also argued they satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) because common issues of law or fact predominated over issues affecting only individual members and a class action was the superior method of adjudicating the controversy. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3). To establish the predominance of class-wide issues with respect to the reliance element of their securities fraud claim, plaintiffs argued they were entitled to a presumption that all class members relied on defendants' misstatements in choosing to buy Goldman stock. The presumption derives from Basic, 485 U.S. 224, and is based on the theory ""that the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations."" Id. at 246. If plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action establish certain prerequisites—namely, that defendants' misstatements were publicly known, their shares traded in an efficient market, and plaintiffs purchased the shares at the market price after the misstatements were made but before the truth was revealed—the court presumes the market price reflected the misstatements and that all class members relied on that price when they chose to buy or sell shares. See Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (Halliburton II), 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2413 (2014).
Defendants opposed class certification by attempting to rebut the Basic presumption. They presented evidence in the form of declarations and sworn affidavits that Goldman stock experienced no price increase on the dates the statements were made, and no price decrease on 34 occasions before 2010 when the press reported Goldman's conflicts of interest in the Abacus, Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf transactions.[5] For example, as early as December 6, 2007, the Financial Times ran a story suggesting that ""Goldman's Glory May [B]e Short-lived,"" due to numerous accusations that it ""behave[ed] unethically and perhaps [broke] the law"" in taking massive short positions in the U.S. housing market. The article questioned Goldman's ability to ""manage conflicts,"" noting that ""Goldman ha[d] been more aggressive than any other bank"" in ""advis[ing] a company on a transaction, financ[ing] it and invest[ing] its own money."" Approximately one week later, the Dow Jones Business News reported that Goldman had been subpoenaed for its role in various CDO transactions that presented a ""massive conflict of interest with major liabilities."" Defendants' expert presented evidence that Goldman's stock experienced no price decline in response to these or similar reports about Goldman's conflicts in the CDOs.
Because the market did not react to defendants' misstatements on the dates they were made or on the dates defendants claim the truth about Goldman's conflicts was revealed, defendants argued the misstatements did not affect the price of Goldman stock and plaintiffs could not have relied on them in choosing to buy shares at that price.[6]
Without holding an evidentiary hearing or oral argument, the District Court rejected defendants' arguments and certified the class. See In re Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 10 Civ. 3461, 2015 WL 5613150 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2015). It concluded plaintiffs met all four elements of Rule 23(a) and established predominance under Rule 23(b)(3) by invoking the Basic presumption of reliance. Id. at *3, 7. Although the court acknowledged that defendants may rebut the Basic presumption by a ""preponderance of the evidence,"" id. at *4 n.3, it held that defendants failed to do so in this case because they ""d[id] not provide conclusive evidence that no link exists between the price decline [of Goldman stock] and the misrepresentation[s]."" Id. at *7.
The District Court rejected defendants' evidence that the price of Goldman stock did not increase on the dates the misstatements were made, because it determined they could have served to maintain an already inflated stock price. See id. at *6. It also rejected defendants' evidence concerning a lack of price impact when the news reported Goldman's conflicts in the CDOs, because, in its view, defendants' evidence was either ""an inappropriate truth on the market defense"" or an argument for materiality that the court ""w[ould] not consider"" at the class certification stage. Id. at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if it were to consider the evidence, the court held it did not rebut the Basic presumption of reliance because it ""failed to conclusively sever th[e] link"" between defendants' statements and the market price of Goldman stock. Id. at *7. Accordingly, the court held plaintiffs were entitled to the presumption of reliance and certified the class. Id. We granted defendants' petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f).
DISCUSSION
No one disputes that plaintiffs satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a). The battle is joined over whether plaintiffs can meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), with respect to the reliance element of their securities fraud claim.[7]
I. Rule 23(b)(3) and the Basic Presumption of Reliance
Reliance in a 10b-5 action ensures ""a proper connection between a defendant's misrepresentation and a plaintiff's injury."" Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co. (Halliburton I), 563 U.S. 804, 810 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""The traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was [personally] aware of a company's statement"" and purchased shares based on it. Id. But requiring that kind of proof in a securities fraud class action ""place[s] an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market."" Basic, 485 U.S. at 245. If every plaintiff had to prove she relied on a misrepresentation in choosing to buy stock, it would effectively prevent investors from proceeding as a class; individual issues of reliance would overwhelm common ones and make certification under Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate in every case.
The Supreme Court in Basic sought to alleviate that concern by permitting securities fraud plaintiffs to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The presumption derives from the ""fraud-on-the-market"" theory, which holds that ""the market price of shares traded on [a] well-developed market[] reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations."" Id. at 246. As the Court in Basic explained:
The fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a company's stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business. . . . Misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.
Id. at 241-42 (internal quotation marks omitted).
""If a market is generally efficient in incorporating publicly available information into a security's market price,"" the fraud-on-the-market theory assumes investors rely on that price as an ""unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information,"" including any material misrepresentations. Amgen, 568 U.S. at 462.
Basic endorsed the fraud-on-the-market theory and applied it to class action lawsuits for securities fraud. It held that if plaintiff-investors prove that a company's misstatement was public, the company's stock traded in an efficient market, and the plaintiffs purchased the stock after the misstatement was made but before the truth was revealed, they are entitled to a presumption that the misstatement affected the stock price and that they purchased stock in reliance on the integrity of that price. Basic, 485 U.S. at 247, 248 n.27. Under the Basic presumption, individual class members need not prove they actually relied upon (or even knew about) the misstatement giving rise to their claim; ""anyone who buys or sells the stock at the market price may be considered to have relied on th[e] misstatement[]."" Halliburton II, 134 S. Ct. at 2405.
The Basic presumption does not eliminate the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) or the reliance element of a 10b-5 action for fraud. It simply provides an alternative means of satisfying those requirements, enabling class action litigation of securities fraud claims where none previously could have survived. See id. at 2414. Accordingly, defendants opposing class certification may rebut the presumption of reliance ""through evidence that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock price."" Id.
The ""fundamental premise"" underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory is ""that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation"" that ""was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction."" Halliburton I, 563 U.S. at 813. If defendants ""sever[] the link"" between the misrepresentation and the market price—by showing, for example, that the misrepresentation was not public, the shares did not trade in an efficient market, or ""the misrepresentation in fact did not lead to a distortion of price""—both the theory and the presumption collapse. Basic, 485 U.S. at 248. ""[T]he basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through market price would be gone,"" and plaintiffs are no longer entitled to the presumption. Id. Instead, each plaintiff must prove she actually relied on defendants' misrepresentations when choosing to buy or sell stock, which dooms the predominance of class-wide issues under Rule 23(b)(3) and defeats class certification. See Halliburton II, 134 S. Ct. at 2416.
II. Rebuttal of the Basic Presumption
The parties agree that plaintiffs established the preliminary elements to invoke the Basic presumption of reliance: defendants' misrepresentations were public, Goldman's shares traded in an efficient market, and the putative class members purchased Goldman stock at the relevant time (after the misstatements were made but before the truth was revealed). The parties also agree that defendants in a securities fraud class action may submit rebuttal evidence of a lack of price impact at the class certification stage. The principal question on appeal is whether defendants bear the burden of production or persuasion to rebut the Basic presumption.
Relying on Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and language in Basic, defendants argue they need only produce—i.e., offer—evidence of a lack of price impact to rebut the presumption. Rule 301 states that ""the party against whom a presumption is directed has the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption,"" while the ""burden of persuasion . . . remains on the party who had it originally."" FED. R. EVID. 301. Because it is plaintiffs' burden to prove the predominance of class-wide issues and the reliance element of their securities fraud claim, defendants argue plaintiffs also bear the ultimate burden to persuade the court that the statements at issue affected the market price of Goldman stock. According to defendants, that rule comports with the language in Basic that ""[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and . . . the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff"" is sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance. Basic, 485 U.S. at 248 (emphasis added). Defendants contend the District Court imposed an impermissibly high evidentiary burden by requiring them to rebut the Basic presumption with conclusive proof of a lack of price impact.
After the District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification, another panel of this Circuit concluded that defendants in a securities fraud class action bear the burden of persuasion to rebut the Basic presumption, and that they must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. See Barclays, 875 F.3d at 99. The Court in Barclays examined ""the development of the presumption and the burden the [Supreme] Court imposed on plaintiffs to invoke it at the class certification stage."" Id. at 100. It determined that the language in Basic that ""[a]ny showing that severs the link"" between the misstatement and the market price places a burden of persuasion, rather than a burden of production, on defendants seeking to rebut the presumption, because it ""requires defendants to do more than merely produce evidence that might result in a favorable outcome."" Id. at 101. They must demonstrate that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock's price. Id.; see also Halliburton II. 134 S. Ct. at 2405 (""[A] defendant c[an] rebut th[e] presumption in a number of ways, including by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock's price— that is, that the misrepresentation had no `price impact.'"").
The Barclays court also rejected the argument that Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires defendants only to produce ""some"" evidence to rebut the presumption. Rule 301 contemplates that a federal statute can alter the traditional rule that the burden of persuasion remains on the party who had it originally. See FED. R. EVID. 301 (""unless a federal statute or these rules provide otherwise . . . the burden of persuasion . . . remains on the party who had it originally""). Because the Basic presumption is a substantive doctrine of federal law that derives from the securities fraud statutes, Barclays determined it altered the default rule and imposed a burden of persuasion on defendants seeking to rebut it. See Barclays, 875 F.3d at 102-03.
That conclusion is consistent with the purpose of the presumption. As the Barclays court observed, the Basic presumption is essential in putative class actions involving securities fraud plaintiffs ""who ha[ve] traded on an impersonal market."" Id. at 101 (internal quotation marks omitted). It would be ""of little value"" if defendants could overcome it ""by simply producing some evidence"" of a lack of price impact. Id. at 100-01 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the panel concluded that Basic and its progeny require defendants seeking to rebut the Basic presumption to ""demonstrate a lack of price impact by a preponderance of the evidence at the class certification stage rather than merely meet a burden of production."" Id. at 101.
Barclays makes clear that defendants seeking to rebut the Basic presumption of reliance must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. See id. Although the District Court acknowledged that standard in a footnote its decision, see In re Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 10 Civ. 3461, 2015 WL 5613150, at *4 n.3, it went on to find that defendants failed to rebut the Basic presumption because they did not ""conclusively"" prove a ""complete absence of price impact,"" id. at *7. Because the District Court concluded its findings with these words, it is unclear to us whether the court required more of defendants than a preponderance of the evidence. We therefore vacate the District Court's order and remand for it to reconsider defendants' evidence in light of the Barclays standard.
III. Defendants' Price Impact Evidence
Because we are remanding to the District Court to reconsider defendants' evidence under the Barclays standard, one final issue regarding defendants' rebuttal evidence needs mention. In their opposition to class certification, defendants' expert presented evidence of 34 dates before 2010 in which various news sources reported Goldman's conflicts of interest in the Abacus, Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf transactions, without any accompanying decline in the price of Goldman stock. The District Court construed this evidence as ""an inappropriate truth on the market defense"" or as evidence of the statements' lack of materiality, neither of which the court thought it could consider at the class certification stage. Id. at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree with defendants that this was error.
The ""truth on the market"" defense attacks the timing of the plaintiffs' purchase of shares, not price impact. The theory is, essentially, that the market was already aware of the truth regarding defendants' misrepresentations at the time the class members purchased their shares, meaning the market price had already adjusted to the revelation of defendants' misstatements, and class members could not have relied on those misstatements in choosing to buy stock. See Amgen, 568 U.S. at 482; see also Basic, 485 U.S. at 248-49.
Contrary to the District Court's characterization of their evidence, defendants did not present a ""truth on the market"" defense. Defendants did not argue, for example, that Goldman's conflicts of interest were already known to the market at the time plaintiffs purchased their shares of Goldman common stock. Indeed, it was undisputed that plaintiffs purchased their shares after the misstatements were made but before the truth was revealed. Rather, defendants presented evidence that the market learned the truth about Goldman's conflicts of interests in the Abacus, Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf transactions on 34 occasions from 2007 to 2009, without any accompanying decline in the price of Goldman stock. Defendants used that evidence to show that their statements about Goldman's efforts to avoid conflicts of interest ""did not actually affect the stock's market price."" Halliburton II, 134 S. Ct. at 2416.
Although price impact touches on materiality, which is not an appropriate consideration at the class certification stage, it ""differs from materiality in a crucial respect."" Id. Price impact ""refers to the effect of a misrepresentation on a stock price."" Halliburton I, 563 U.S. at 814. Whether a misrepresentation was reflected in the market price at the time of the transaction—whether it had price impact—""is Basic's fundamental premise. It . . . has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage."" Halliburton II, 134 S. Ct. at 2416 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If a defendant shows that an ""alleged misrepresentation did not, for whatever reason, actually affect the market price"" of defendant's stock, ""there is no grounding for any contention that the investor indirectly relied on that misrepresentation through his reliance on the integrity of the market price""; the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying the presumption would ""completely collapse[]."" Id. at 2408, 2414 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).
Accordingly, the District Court erred in declining to consider defendants' evidence at this stage of the litigation. We espouse no views as to whether the evidence is sufficient to rebut the Basic presumption; we hold only that the District Court should consider it on remand, in determining whether defendants established by a preponderance of the evidence that the misrepresentations did not in fact affect the market price of Goldman stock. We encourage the court to hold any evidentiary hearing or oral argument it deems appropriate under the circumstances.
CONCLUSION
Defendants seeking to rebut the Basic presumption of reliance must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. See Barclays, 875 F.3d at 99. Because it is unclear whether the District Court applied the correct standard in this case, we VACATE the order of the District Court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

[1]  Plaintiffs also alleged defendants failed to disclose Goldman's receipt of ""Wells Notices,"" which are sent by the SEC in order to inform a firm that the SEC intends to bring an enforcement action against it. The District Court dismissed that cause of action and it is not at issue in this appeal. See Richman v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 261, 269, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).
[2]  The Complaint identified a fourth corrective disclosure on April 26, 2010, but plaintiffs have abandoned any reliance on that disclosure, which did not contain news of government enforcement activities and caused no statistically significant movement in the price of Goldman's stock.
[3]  A ""corrective disclosure"" is an announcement or series of announcements that reveals to the market the falsity of a prior statement. See Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 396 F.3d 161, 175 n.4 (2d Cir. 2005).
[4]  Those elements are ""(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation."" Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 157 (2008).
[5]  Both plaintiffs' and defendants' experts used ""event studies"" to determine whether an event or news report caused a statistically significant change in the price of Goldman's stock. An event study isolates the stock price movement attributable to a company (as opposed to market-wide or industry-wide movements) and then examines whether the price movement on a given date is outside the range of typical random stock price fluctuations observed for that stock. If the isolated stock price movement falls outside the range of typical random stock price fluctuations, it is statistically significant. If the stock price movement is indistinguishable from random price fluctuations, it cannot be attributed to company-specific information announced on the event date. See Mark L. Mitchell & Jeffry M. Netter, The Role of Financial Economics in Securities Fraud Cases: Applications at the Securities & Exchange Commission, 49 BUS. LAW. 545, 556-69 (1994).
[6]  Defendants challenged the materiality of the misstatements again in their opposition to the motion for class certification. Although materiality is ""an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market theory,"" it is common to the class and does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466-67 (2013). Therefore, the District Court correctly held that plaintiffs need not prove the materiality of defendants' misstatements at the class certification stage, and we do not consider it on appeal.
[7]  The burden of proving compliance with Rule 23 rests with the party moving for class certification. See Levitt v. J.P. Morgan Sec., Inc., 710 F.3d 454, 465 (2d Cir. 2013). On appeal, we review the District Court's grant of class certification for an abuse of discretion, and the legal conclusions underlying that decision de novo. See Barclays, 875 F.3d at 92. When a case involves the application of legal standards, we look at whether the District Court's application ""falls within the range of permissible decisions."" Id.

Argued: October 26, 2017.
Decided: January 25, 2018.
In the course of defending against claims that it sold counterfeit products, defendant-appellant ePRO E-Commerce Limited (""ePRO"") engaged in persistent discovery misconduct. ePRO brings this interlocutory appeal challenging the resulting imposition of discovery sanctions, including, inter alia, an order that it pay the costs incurred by its opponent, plaintiff-appellee Klipsch Group, Inc., as a result of ePRO's misconduct, and a restraint on $5 million of ePRO's assets. ePRO raises various challenges to the district court's evidentiary rulings and factual findings. It also contends that the resulting sanctions are impermissibly punitive, primarily because they are disproportionate to the likely value of the case. Klipsch, on cross-appeal, argues that the district court erred by failing to infer that ePRO destroyed relevant sales data from the fact that it failed to retain backup copies of its live sales database.
We find no error in the district court's factual findings, and we conclude that the monetary sanctions it awarded properly compensated Klipsch for the corrective discovery efforts it undertook with court permission in response to ePRO's misconduct. The district court's orders imposing sanctions are therefore AFFIRMED in all respects.

Before: JACOBS and LYNCH, Circuit Judges, and CROTTY, District Judge.[**]
GERARD E. LYNCH, Circuit Judge.
In the course of defending against claims that it sold counterfeit products, defendant-appellant ePRO E-Commerce Limited (""ePRO"") engaged in persistent discovery misconduct: it failed to timely disclose the majority of the responsive documents in its possession, restricted a discovery vendor's access to its electronic data, and failed to impose an adequate litigation hold even after the court directed it to do so, which omission allowed custodians of relevant electronic data to delete thousands of documents and significant quantities of data, sometimes permanently. As a result, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Vernon S. Broderick, J.) concluded that ePRO had willfully engaged in spoliation. It accordingly granted in substantial part plaintiff-appellee Klipsch Group, Inc.'s (""Klipsch"") motion for discovery sanctions, including a $2.7 million monetary sanction to compensate Klipsch for its corrective discovery efforts and a corresponding asset restraint in that amount, permissive and mandatory jury instructions, and an additional $2.3 million bond to preserve Klipsch's ability to recover damages and fees at the end of the case. ePRO now brings this interlocutory appeal, raising various challenges to the evidentiary rulings and factual findings undergirding those sanctions. It also contends that the resulting sanctions are impermissibly punitive, primarily because they are disproportionate to the likely value of the case. Klipsch, on cross-appeal, argues that the district court erred by failing to infer that ePRO destroyed relevant sales data from the fact that it failed to retain backup copies of its live sales database.
We find no error in the district court's factual findings, and we conclude that the monetary sanctions it awarded properly compensated Klipsch for the corrective discovery efforts it undertook with court permission in response to ePRO's misconduct. In particular, we emphasize that discovery sanctions should be commensurate with the costs unnecessarily created by the sanctionable behavior. A monetary sanction in the amount of the cost of discovery efforts that appeared to be reasonable to undertake ex ante does not become impermissibly punitive simply because those efforts did not ultimately uncover more significant spoliation and fraud, or increase the likely damages in the underlying case. The district court's orders imposing sanctions are accordingly AFFIRMED in all respects.
BACKGROUND
The facts presented below are drawn principally from the district court's findings of fact.
I. Initial Steps in the Litigation
In August 2012, Klipsch, a manufacturer of sound equipment including headphones, sued DealExtreme.com, a subsidiary of ePRO, a Chinese corporation, alleging that it was selling counterfeit Klipsch headphones. ePRO does not dispute that some infringing sales occurred; however, throughout the proceedings, the parties have insisted on vastly different estimates of the extent of such sales. Klipsch alleged that ePRO sold at least $5 million in counterfeit or otherwise infringing Klipsch products. ePRO, on the other hand, has consistently presented evidence that the sales of the relevant products amounted to less than $8,000 worldwide. The district court initially found ePRO's evidence persuasive and did not substantially revise its view of the case's value even after Klipsch's investigators uncovered two other counterfeit Klipsch products being sold on ePRO's sites a few months into the litigation.
As the case proceeded, however, ePRO's failure to comply with its discovery obligations began to cast doubt on the reliability of its representations. By March 2013, as Klipsch was preparing to take depositions of ePRO's employees in Hong Kong, ePRO had produced fewer than 500 documents. ePRO insisted that it did not possess any original sales documents, and instead turned over spreadsheets created specifically for this litigation that purported to list all relevant sales. In support of its contention that those sales records were complete, ePRO points out that each of the undercover purchases made by Klipsch's investigators was accounted for therein, even though ePRO would have had no a priori means of identifying those transactions.
During a deposition of ePRO's CEO, Daniel Chow, it became clear that ePRO had not placed a litigation hold on a substantial portion of its electronic data, including any emails or faxes. Around the same time, ePRO also admitted that it did possess transactional sales documents that should have been disclosed. In order to remedy those problems, ePRO agreed to retain a discovery vendor, FTI Consulting, to conduct a keyword search of its electronic documents. FTI's search resulted in the production of an additional 40,000 documents, including 1,236 original sales documents. Some of the documents that were produced contradicted Chow's testimony, suggesting that ePRO had misidentified the suppliers of the counterfeit products. And although the new production was voluminous, there were also indications that ePRO had artificially limited FTI's investigation into its electronic records. In light of the new discovery, the magistrate judge supervising discovery (Michael H. Dolinger, M.J.) deemed it necessary for Klipsch to re-depose ePRO's employees.[1] At Chow's second deposition in November 2013, it became clear that, despite the magistrate judge's clear directive, ePRO still had not imposed an adequate litigation hold. It is not contested that ePRO's counsel had advised compliance and warned that noncompliance would bring consequences.
II. The Motion for Discovery Sanctions
In December 2013, Klipsch moved for discovery sanctions, asserting that as a result of ePRO's failure to initiate a proper litigation hold or to promptly disclose documents, large quantities of relevant documents that would have reflected a larger volume of infringing sales had been lost. The magistrate judge agreed in large part, observing that ePRO's ""trail of false and misleading representations"" throughout the discovery process had created ""evident uncertainty about the plausibility, as well as the accuracy, of the defendants' current factual assertions about the scope of infringing sales and resultant profits."" Joint App. at 1184. But although the magistrate judge determined that ePRO had ""substantially failed to meet [its] obligation to preserve, search for and timely produce documents,"" id. at 1182, he declined to impose sanctions against ePRO at that time. Instead, he authorized Klipsch to undertake an independent forensic examination of ePRO's computer systems. The magistrate judge instructed that Klipsch would pay for the examination in the first instance, and could apply for the apportionment or reallocation of those costs after obtaining the results.
Klipsch hired iDiscovery Services (""iDS""), led by Daniel Regard, to conduct its investigation. Regard's initial report determined that ePRO employees who were custodians of responsive information had deleted files, emails, and other potentially relevant data. With respect to the actual sales data and documents, which the parties refer to as ""Structured ESI,""[2] Regard concluded that ePRO's live sales databases showed evidence of editing and omissions and therefore offered unreliable evidence of historical sales data. Because ePRO had not preserved the backup copies of its databases that it routinely generated for disaster recovery purposes, Regard concluded that no reliable record of historical data was available.
With respect to the information stored on employees' computers and email accounts, which the parties refer to as ""Unstructured ESI,"" Regard found that the custodians had engaged in various forms of spoliation, including manually deleting thousands of files and emails, using data-wiping software shortly before iDS's forensic examination was scheduled to begin, and updating their operating systems during the litigation period, which had the result of clearing out data regarding their program usage. Regard and his team were also denied access to several custodians' email and private messenger accounts, despite ePRO's admission that those accounts were sometimes used for business purposes.
After the search was completed, Klipsch filed an ex parte motion along with Regard's initial report, asking the court to increase the hold on ePRO's assets and enter a default judgment in Klipsch's favor. Klipsch's briefing suggested that Regard's report showed evidence that ePRO had engaged in massive amounts of data-deletion and tampering. The district court increased the hold on ePRO's assets from $20,000 to $5 million and ordered ePRO to show cause why a default judgment should not be entered against it.
In opposition, ePRO submitted expert reports from Michael Jelen, an expert in Structured ESI forensics, and Erik Hammerquist, an expert in Unstructured ESI. Klipsch then submitted an additional declaration from Regard that modified some of his conclusions in response to ePRO's experts' critiques. The district court held a four-day evidentiary hearing on Klipsch's motion in January 2015, following which the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as well as further declarations from Regard and Hammerquist. The district court considered the final Regard report but excluded Hammerquist's proposed sur-rebuttal.
II. The District Court's Sanctions Rulings
In November 2015, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part Klipsch's motion. In summary, it found that Klipsch failed to demonstrate that ePRO had destroyed or tampered with its sales documents. The court accordingly denied Klipsch's motion for default judgment and reduced the asset restraining order to $25,000, reflecting its view of the likely valuation of actual damages in the case.
The court concluded that Klipsch had shown that ePRO had willfully spoliated relevant Unstructured ESI. Although many of the improperly deleted documents were recovered and no smoking gun was found among them, the district court emphasized that spoliation had resulted in some permanently unrecoverable files and data, and inferred from ePRO's willful misconduct that the missing documents were relevant and that their absence prejudiced Klipsch. As a result, it imposed the following sanctions: (1) an instruction requiring the jury to find that ePRO had destroyed relevant Unstructured ESI after its duty to preserve those documents had been triggered; (2) an instruction permitting the jury to presume that the destroyed evidence would have been favorable to Klipsch; and (3) reasonable costs and fees associated with the discovery motion, beginning with Klipsch's second round of depositions in Hong Kong.
Both parties moved for reconsideration. Other than a small revision to one aspect of its Unstructured ESI findings, however, the district court's ruling remained unchanged. After a careful examination of Klipsch's fee submissions, the court awarded Klipsch a total of $2.68 million as compensation for the additional discovery efforts occasioned by ePRO's misconduct.[3] The court rejected ePRO's arguments that the amount was excessive either as compared to the small amount of actual compensatory damages likely at issue in the case, or as a result of Klipsch's failure to uncover evidence of any additional infringing sales or spoliation of sales records.
The court deemed ePRO to be a dissipation risk in light of its persistent failure to comply with court orders or discovery protocols. It accordingly imposed a restraint on ePRO's assets in the amount of the monetary sanctions. It also imposed an additional $2.3 million restraint, which amount it determined would be appropriate to secure Klipsch's likely recovery of treble damages and attorney's fees at the conclusion of the case. At ePRO's request, the court permitted the parties to determine whether the resulting $5 million in total restraints would be held in a restraint, a separate bond, or some combination thereof.
The parties now appeal those rulings.
DISCUSSION
As a preliminary matter, we note that the restraint on ePRO's assets is a form of injunctive relief that provides the basis for our jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Because the remainder of the parties' arguments concern matters that are inextricably bound up with the validity of that injunction, we also have jurisdiction to resolve those disputes. See Amador v. Andrews, 655 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 2011).
We review each of the issues raised in these cross-appeals for abuse of discretion. See West v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 167 F.3d 776, 779 (2d Cir. 1999) (discovery sanctions); United States v. Fabian, 312 F.3d 550, 557 (2d Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Parkes, 497 F.3d 220 (2d Cir. 2007) (evidentiary determinations); EEOC v. KarenKim, Inc., 698 F.3d 92, 99 (2d Cir. 2012) (grant of injunctive relief). ""A district court abuses its discretion if it (1) bases its decision on an error of law or uses the wrong legal standard; (2) bases its decision on a clearly erroneous factual finding; or (3) reaches a conclusion that, though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding, cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions."" KarenKim, 698 F.3d at 99-100 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We determine that the district court did not err in its careful factual findings, nor did it base any aspect of its decision on an incorrect legal standard. The primary engine of ePRO's appeal appears to be the fact that the district court imposed $2.7 million in sanctions in a case that it agreed will likely result in about $20,000 in damages. We hold that the district court's award properly reflects the additional costs ePRO imposed on its opponent by refusing to comply with its discovery obligations. Because we conclude that the remainder of the parties' arguments are also without merit, we affirm the district court's rulings.
I. Evidentiary and Factual Arguments
The parties raise an assortment of evidentiary and factual challenges to the district court's rulings. We assume the parties' familiarity with the issues and we commend the district court for its cogent explanation of the highly technical factual details underpinning these debates.
A. Evidence Considered by the District Court
ePRO argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting Regard's supplemental reports and declarations, and by relying on any of his reports for the truth of the matter asserted therein. None of those evidentiary challenges has merit.
First, ePRO argues that some of Klipsch's evidence should not have been considered because it was not timely submitted. The materials ePRO contends should have been excluded, however, were provided to ePRO before the January 2015 hearing. Although it is unclear from the record before us whether ePRO has adequately preserved its objection to the admission of that evidence, the district court was aware of ePRO's concerns about the timing of the disclosures, and, indeed, granted ePRO's motion to strike (other) evidence that was submitted only days before the hearing. We see no abuse of discretion in those rulings.
Next, ePRO argues that the district court abused its discretion when it considered Klipsch's post-hearing supplemental expert report, but rejected ePRO's response. It is not an abuse of discretion to give one party the last word, particularly after the court has already permitted the parties to exchange multiple expert reports and to cross-examine witnesses during a multi-day evidentiary hearing. In any event, striking the portions of the district court's factual findings that relied solely on Regard's final report would have no impact on the validity of its overall ruling.
Finally, ePRO argues that Regard's reports should not have been relied on for the truth of the matters asserted therein because the district court allegedly sustained ePRO's objection to the admission of his initial report for that purpose. But ePRO did not object to the acceptance of Regard as an expert, and his reports simply provided the factual details supporting his expert opinions. Thus, we conclude that challenge, too, lacks merit.
B. Spoliation of Unstructured ESI
ePRO argues that the district court erred when it found that ePRO had willfully spoliated Unstructured ESI. The district court found evidence of five methods of spoliation: (1) 4,596 responsive files or emails were manually deleted, although all of these documents were eventually recovered;[4] (2) seven employees used data-wiping programs shortly before the forensic examination began, resulting in 31 permanently unrecoverable files; (3) eighteen employees ran operating systems upgrades during the litigation hold period, which resulted in the loss of their program usage data; (4) ePRO failed to provide access to the email accounts of seven employees who had worked on its email direct marketing homepage but were no longer employed with the company, and deleted or failed to provide access to the email accounts of twelve other custodians of discoverable data; and (5) 32 out of 36 identified custodians, including ePRO's CFO and the employee coordinating Regard's access to ePRO's data for his examination, refused to permit access to their accounts on a private messaging system, which, although primarily used for personal communication, were listed on their corporate email signatures.
The party seeking discovery sanctions on the basis of spoliation must show by a preponderance of the evidence: ""(1) that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and (3) that the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party's claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense."" Chin v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J, 685 F.3d 135, 162 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The district court did not clearly err in determining that each of those elements had been met here. ePRO's arguments to the contrary with respect to the manually deleted emails and the operating system reinstallations fail to recognize that the district court did not find that each instance of spoliation was equally probative of willfulness, nor that every method resulted in the permanent destruction of presumptively relevant data. Instead, the district court inferred relevance and prejudice only from the unrecoverable data, and viewed the various means of deleting data as cumulative proof that ePRO's spoliation was willful.
ePRO also spends significant effort trying to undermine the district court's factual findings regarding exactly which employee used which data-wiping program at which time. But ePRO does not contest that the district court properly made the following findings: multiple custodians of discoverable data had data-wiping software on their devices during the litigation hold period; at least some of those programs were last used at a time very close to the initiation of Klipsch's forensic examination; and the use of those programs resulted in the permanent deletion of 31 files. Those facts are sufficient to support the district court's finding of willful spoliation, and ePRO's expert's opinion that some of the specific data had been commingled and therefore could not reliably be attributed to any particular individual does not change that conclusion. Moreover, ePRO's evidence on commingling was contested and to some extent incomplete because ePRO's expert testified that commingling was only one possible explanation for the duplicative data. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err when it declined to adopt ePRO's view of the evidence.
Finally, ePRO contends that its inability to provide access to certain email and messaging accounts should not have been construed as evidence of willful spoliation because those accounts were primarily for private use. But the district court determined that ePRO was required to provide access to all of those accounts because they were also sanctioned for business use. As the district court noted, it was undisputed that ePRO's employees included their private messaging addresses in their work email signatures, installed the messaging software on their work computers, and sometimes used the specified private email accounts for business reasons. That ePRO did not have a software usage policy in place requiring its employees to segregate personal and business accounts or to otherwise ensure that professional communications sent through personal accounts could be preserved by the company for litigation purposes was the company's own error. ePRO cannot use that oversight as an excuse to avoid discovery, nor can it complain because the resulting and wholly foreseeable deletion of material that could well have contained relevant evidence gave rise to sanctions.
Thus, we find no clear error in the district court's factual findings regarding the spoliation of Unstructured ESI.[5]
C. Lack of Spoliation of Structured ESI
In what has been styled a cross-appeal but might be better understood as advocating an additional or alternative ground on which to affirm the sanctions, Klipsch argues that the district court erred when it declined to find that ePRO had willfully spoliated direct evidence of sales, which the parties refer to as ""Structured ESI."" Klipsch concedes that its examination did not uncover any direct evidence that ePRO's sales data had actually been tampered with, nor that ePRO was otherwise concealing a greater volume of infringing sales. Instead, Klipsch argues that ePRO's failure to preserve static backup copies of its sales databases deprived Klipsch of a crucial means of verifying the historical accuracy of its live sales data.
ePRO maintains a live sales database that extracts and cross-references data from separate modules tracking inventory, orders, and shipments. Regard observed that the sales records in the live database were consistent with what had previously been produced, but because he found evidence that the database had been subject to editing, he nevertheless concluded that the sales records were unreliable. Jelen, ePRO's Structured ESI expert, agreed that it was possible to edit the live database and noted that some such edits would be expected in the normal course of business; however, he opined that it would be extremely difficult to completely remove evidence of a transaction from all three modules, and noted there was no evidence of such an effort nor of any inconsistency across the modules.
In addition to the live database, ePRO's policies also require it to generate backup copies of the sales database for disaster recovery purposes on a regular basis as well as every time the system undergoes a specified ""major event."" Those copies presumably would not have been subject to editing in the normal course, and therefore could have been used as references against which to check the accuracy of the live data. Klipsch asserts that ePRO had an obligation to preserve the backup copies of its sales databases as unique sources of historical sales data.
But even where a party has shown that its opponent had an obligation to preserve certain evidence and willfully failed to do so, sanctions need not automatically follow; instead, we have simply held that such conduct may provide sufficient circumstantial evidence that relevant and prejudicial data was lost. See, e.g., Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 247 F.3d 423, 436 (2d Cir. 2001) (""Once a court has concluded that a party was under an obligation to preserve the evidence that it destroyed, it must then consider whether the evidence was intentionally destroyed, and the likely contents of that evidence. The determination of an appropriate sanction for spoliation, if any, is confined to the discretion of the trial judge[.]"") (internal citations omitted). That is to say, the district court retains its discretion to impose discovery sanctions—or not—so long as that determination is not based on a legal or factual error. See id. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion here when it chose not to infer that the lost backups would have included information that was relevant or that its unavailability prejudiced Klipsch. Jelen's testimony provided adequate support for a determination that the otherwise undetectable destruction of sales data was unlikely, and, as the district court pointed out, even Klipsch's own expert was unwilling to affirmatively endorse the theory that such conduct had actually occurred.
In sum, we find no clear error with respect to the district court's factual findings, nor any abuse of discretion with respect to its evidentiary rulings.
II. Amount of Monetary Sanction
ePRO argues that the monetary sanctions imposed against it are so out of proportion to the value of the evidence uncovered by Klipsch's efforts or to the likely ultimate value of the case as to be impermissibly punitive and a violation of due process. That position, although superficially sympathetic given the amount of the sanction, overlooks the fact that ePRO caused Klipsch to accrue those costs by failing to comply with its discovery obligations. Such compliance is not optional or negotiable; rather, the integrity of our civil litigation process requires that the parties before us, although adversarial to one another, carry out their duties to maintain and disclose the relevant information in their possession in good faith.
The extremely broad discovery permitted by the Federal Rules depends on the parties' voluntary participation. The system functions because, in the vast majority of cases, we can rely on each side to preserve evidence and to disclose relevant information when asked (and sometimes even before then) without being forced to proceed at the point of a court order. See Cine Forty-Second St. Theatre Corp. v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., 602 F.2d 1062, 1068 (2d Cir. 1979) (observing that ""embroil[ing] trial judges in day-to-day supervision of discovery"" is ""a result directly contrary to the overall scheme of the federal discovery rules""). The courts are ill-equipped to address parties that do not voluntarily comply: we do not have our own investigatory powers, and even if we did, the spoliation of evidence would frequently be extremely difficult for any outsider to detect.
Moreover, noncompliance vastly increases the cost of litigation by drawing out deadlines and necessitating motion practice. But ""[a]n undertaking on the scale of the large contemporary suit brooks none of the dilation, posturing, and harassment once expected in litigation."" Id. at 1067-68. Accordingly, we have held that discovery sanctions are proper even against parties who have belatedly complied with their obligations, because an alternative rule ""would encourage dilatory tactics, and compliance with discovery orders would come only when the backs of counsel and the litigants were against the wall."" Id. at 1068; see also S. New Eng. Tel. Co. v. Glob. NAPs Inc., 624 F.3d 123, 149 (2d Cir. 2010). When, as a result of an opponent's persistently uncooperative behavior, it appears reasonable ex ante to conduct expensive corrective discovery efforts, we see no reason why the party required to undertake those efforts should not be compensated simply because it eventually turned out that the obstructive conduct had hidden nothing of real value to the case. Those costs must be placed on the uncooperative opponent in order to deter recalcitrant parties from the cavalier destruction or concealment of materials that the law requires them to retain and disclose.
When we apply those principles to the case at hand, it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing monetary sanctions calculated to make Klipsch whole for the extra cost and efforts it reasonably undertook in response to ePRO's recalcitrance. Even accepting the district court's conclusion that Klipsch's forensic review failed to uncover proof that evidence of additional infringing sales had been destroyed, neither Klipsch nor the magistrate judge was in any position to know that such would prove to be the case before Klipsch undertook its review. On the contrary, ePRO's persistent refusal to comply with the discovery process provided ample grounds to suspect that the degree of its obstructive conduct would be commensurate with the value of the evidence it was hiding from its adversary and the court.
ePRO's principal objections to that conclusion fall into two buckets: first, it invokes Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to suggest that the district court has rewarded Klipsch for engaging in unnecessary and excessive discovery; and second, it argues that the sanctions are disproportionate either to the degree of success Klipsch achieved on its motion or to the ultimate value of the case. We find both arguments unconvincing.
A. Rule 37's Limitations on Unnecessary Discovery Sanctions
ePRO challenges the fee amount as failing to adhere to the principles provided by Rule 37(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs when a court may impose sanctions for the spoliation of electronically stored information. The district court did not, in fact, rely on Rule 37 as the grounds for the monetary sanctions; instead, the sanctions were imposed under the court's inherent power to manage its own affairs.[6] Nevertheless, ePRO argues that the monetary sanctions were inappropriate under either source of authority. It argues that the monetary sanctions imposed here improperly reward Klipsch for excessive discovery efforts, suggesting Klipsch was not justified in taking such expensive measures to obtain the documents to which it was entitled because it should have known that the ultimate recovery on the merits would remain small in any event. Alternatively, ePRO argues that Klipsch should not be compensated for these efforts because it would have undertaken them regardless of ePRO's conduct. Neither of those arguments finds support in the record before us.
First, we note that there is no special rule requiring parties to suffer an opponent's open and notorious discovery misconduct in small value cases. Moreover, it is important to recognize the context in which Klipsch undertook its forensic examination of ePRO's files. At that point, the magistrate judge supervising discovery observed that ePRO's evasive conduct had created ""evident uncertainty"" about the accuracy of its representations regarding the likely value of the case. Joint App. at 1184. Klipsch had every reason to suspect that the documents its search would uncover were likely to be even more damaging than the ones ePRO had already grudgingly disclosed, which suggested that ePRO had misled Klipsch and the court about the provenance of the infringing products and the nature of its business.
Second, the history of the case makes clear that the sanctions and fees awarded in this case were carefully limited to costs Klipsch incurred in direct response to ePRO's misconduct. Klipsch obtained approval from the magistrate judge prior to each of its substantive efforts, and in each case, that approval was given only after ePRO had already squandered an opportunity to correct its own errors. For example, ePRO's failure to implement a litigation hold was first discovered in March 2013, during Klipsch's first round of depositions with ePRO employees, but ePRO was not sanctioned at that time, nor was Klipsch given carte blanche to explore ePRO's files. Instead, ePRO was permitted to hire its own discovery expert to correct the error, which resulted in the production of substantial additional discovery. Klipsch then spent approximately $550,000 on a second round of depositions occasioned by that late production. It is evident that the district court did not detect any abusive conduct on the part of Klipsch, such as the piling on of discovery demands and investigatory initiatives in order to burden its adversary with wasteful expenses, motions practice, and sanctions. ePRO does not appear to contest the reasonableness of permitting Klipsch to take those remedial depositions, nor can it plausibly assert that Klipsch would have insisted on doing so even if ePRO's initial production had been complete or timely. And only in March 2014, after ePRO had repeatedly shown itself to be an untrustworthy participant in the discovery process, did the magistrate judge determine that Klipsch was ""fully justified"" in seeking to undertake an independent forensic examination. Joint App. at 1187.
Because the costs for which Klipsch is being compensated were reasonably incurred in direct response to ePRO's misconduct, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by requiring ePRO to pay monetary sanctions in that amount.[7]
B. Proportionality
Even assuming that Klipsch reasonably undertook these efforts, ePRO contends that the monetary sanctions should nevertheless be reduced on the basis of a principle of proportionality putatively borrowed from fee-shifting cases in the civil rights context.
ePRO first argues that Klipsch should not be completely compensated for its efforts because it did not achieve complete success on its motion. The district court did, however, grant Klipsch substantial relief: it upheld Klipsch's contention that ePRO willfully failed to fulfill its discovery obligations after several court warnings, and it determined that ePRO's spoliation of its Unstructured ESI was sufficiently serious to warrant adverse jury instructions. See Metrokane, Inc. v. Built NY, Inc., No. 06 CIV. 14447(LAK)(MHD), 2009 WL 637111, at *4 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2009) (determining a discovery sanctions motion to be substantially successful where ""the court upheld the movant's contention that Metrokane had failed to fulfill its discovery obligations in the very manner suggested by Built N.Y. and awarded a full range of appropriate relief""). That the district court chose not to view Klipsch's failure to demonstrate willful spoliation of Structured ESI as a lack of success sufficient to justify a proportional reduction of the monetary sanctions was a decision soundly within its discretion.
ePRO also takes various tacks to assert that the sanction should be reduced in light of the small amount of money likely at issue on the merits. But it has not identified any authority limiting a district court's discretion to award a compensatory discovery sanction on the basis of the ultimate damages award. Instead, because discovery sanctions are typically decided independently from the ultimate outcome of the case, it appears that courts routinely award such sanctions without any discussion of the ultimate merits recovery. See, e.g., E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., No. 3:09-CV-058, 2013 WL 458532, at *3 & n.2 (E.D. Va. Feb. 6, 2013) (observing that there was no need to consider the amount in controversy as a factor in setting a proper discovery sanction); Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., No. 05-CV-1958-B (BLM), 2008 WL 66932, at *17 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2008), vacated in part on other grounds, No. 05-CV-1958-RMB (BLM), 2008 WL 638108 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2008) (making no reference to the ultimate recovery in the case). And in the present circumstance, the discovery motion at issue was decided before the case has concluded; accordingly, tethering monetary sanctions to the ultimate amount in controversy would restrict the court's discretion to a number that remains speculative and indeterminate.
It is hardly clear, in any event, that the civil rights cases provide an appropriate analogy for discovery sanctions.[8] Congress has provided for fee-shifting in that context in order to provide an incentive to qualified counsel to undertake representation of impecunious plaintiffs with meritorious cases. See Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, 559 U.S. 542, 552 (2010). But that provision was also intended to avoid ""windfalls to attorneys"" that would result from granting them fees no sane, paying client would expend in pursuit of the same relief. Id. Accordingly, courts have sometimes held that claims seeking large fees for minuscule success should be reduced or denied. See, e.g., Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 115 (1992) (observing that a nominal damages award usually will not support any accompanying attorney's fee award); Husain v. Springer, 579 F. App'x 3, 5 (2d Cir. 2014) (reducing fee award in light of the plaintiffs' limited success and recovery).
Discovery sanctions are different. As we have emphasized above, a party that disregards its obligations may create a reasonable suspicion that further investigation is warranted, and thereby imposes costs on its adversary that would never have been incurred had the party complied with its obligations in the first instance. In that situation, the offended adversary's counsel is not being rewarded for its success in the litigation; rather, the adversary is simply being compensated for costs it should not have had to bear.
Moreover, to whatever extent that civil rights fee-shifting cases might provide a useful comparison, they do not provide unequivocal support for ePRO's proportionality arguments. Because success in some meritorious civil rights cases will reasonably require attorney's fees in excess of the plaintiff's ultimate recovery, we have stated in that context that ""[a] presumptively correct `lodestar' figure should not be reduced simply because a plaintiff recovered a low damage award."" Cowan v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 935 F.2d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1991). And we have recognized that the conduct of the opposing party commonly justifies the award of such ""disproportionate"" fees. In Kassim v. City of Schenectady, 415 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2005), we explained:
[I]n litigating a matter, an attorney is in part reacting to forces beyond the attorney's control, particularly the conduct of opposing counsel and of the court. If the attorney is compelled to defend against frivolous motions and to make motions to compel compliance with routine discovery demands, or to respond to unreasonable demands of the court for briefing or for wasteful, time-consuming court appearances, the hours required to litigate even a simple matter can expand enormously. It is therefore difficult to generalize about the appropriate size of the fee in relation to the amount in controversy.
Id. at 252; see also Serin v. N. Leasing Sys., Inc., 501 F. App'x 39, 41 (2d Cir. 2012) (same).
In sum, we see nothing in ePRO's proportionality arguments compelling us to conclude that the district court abused its discretion by awarding full compensation for efforts that were ex ante a reasonable response to ePRO's own evasive conduct.[9] The proportionality that matters here is that the amount of the sanctions was plainly proportionate—indeed, it was exactly equivalent—to the costs ePRO inflicted on Klipsch in its reasonable efforts to remedy ePRO's misconduct.
III. Amount of Asset Restraints
The district court concluded that ePRO, a foreign company with few ties to the United States, had shown itself to be a dissipation risk by repeatedly failing to comply with court orders or its own attorneys' instructions. It therefore imposed two mechanisms to ensure Klipsch's full recovery: first, it restrained $2.7 million of ePRO's assets to cover the amount of the monetary sanctions; and second, it required ePRO to post a bond for $2.3 million, a sum representing what the court deemed to be Klipsch's likely recovery on the merits as well as its remaining attorney's fees, which would be recoverable under the Lanham Act. At ePRO's request, however, it permitted ePRO to hold the full $5 million in either an asset restraint, a bond, or some combination thereof.
ePRO now contends that the district court's rulings are contradictory because the court determined that the infringing sales were unlikely to exceed $8,000, but nevertheless imposed a $5 million asset restraint. That argument simply ignores the district court's explanation that the total sum is intended to cover the monetary sanctions and remaining attorney's fees in the case in addition to the merits award, and, as the court pointed out, there is ample precedent for requiring the posting of a bond in these circumstances. See Johnson v. Kassovitz, No. 97 CIV. 5789 DLC, 1998 WL 655534, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 1998) (in the context of the Lanham Act, observing that security of attorney's fees may be included in a bond for costs under S.D.N.Y. Local Rule 54.2) (collecting cases).
* * *
Nothing that we say in this opinion should be taken as condoning excessive and disproportionate discovery demands, countenancing the tactical use of discovery sanction motions to inflict gratuitous costs on adversaries, or derogating from the responsibility of district courts to ensure that litigation proceeds in a responsible and cost-efficient manner. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (directing that the Rules of Civil Procedure ""should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action"") (emphasis added); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (scope of discovery should be ""proportional to the needs of the case, considering [inter alia] the amount in controversy""). If it turns out, as the district court has estimated, that the amount of actual damages in this case is modest in relation to the costs spent on the litigation, that would be a highly regrettable outcome.
But the question before the district court, and before us, is which party should be held responsible for those costs. ePRO does not ever contend that Klipsch's initial discovery demands were unreasonable or disproportionate to the merits of the case. Nor does it seriously argue that the magistrate judge erred in allowing Klipsch to take the steps it took to remedy ePRO's refusal to comply with those demands. The district court reasonably concluded, after a full and fair hearing, that it was ePRO's noncompliance with its legal obligations that occasioned the excessive costs in this case, and we find no reason why ePRO should not therefore be required to pay them.
CONCLUSION
We have considered ePRO's remaining arguments and found them unpersuasive. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
[*]   The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to amend the caption as above.
[**]   Judge Paul A. Crotty, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.
[1]  ePRO did not appeal that determination to the district court and does not contend on appeal that the magistrate judge erred in ordering a second round of depositions.
[2]  ""Structured"" and ""Unstructured"" are technical terms taken from the realm of data storage and discovery. We adopt the parties' usage of those terms in this opinion for the sake of clarity.
[3]  The court reduced the amount Klipsch requested by approximately $300,000 because Klipsch failed to provide credentials for one of its attorneys.
[4]  ePRO suggests that Regard initially found 3,489 deleted files and then revised that number with new methodology to 4,596 files. Those numbers are actually drawn from different data sets: the former number was Regard's initial determination as to how many files were permanently deleted by data wiping software, which was eventually revised down to 31; whereas the latter was always the number of emails manually deleted and recovered. As the district court noted, Regard himself explained that distinction on cross-examination.
[5]  Relatedly, ePRO argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the permissive and mandatory adverse inference instructions because the district court determined that the unrecoverable data could be used to infer that ePRO had willfully engaged in infringing sales and Klipsch already had sufficient evidence of willfulness before the spoliation was discovered. We note that the instruction allowing the jury to infer that the lost data would have been favorable to Klipsch was permissive, rather than mandatory. Moreover, as discussed above, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it inferred prejudice from ePRO's spoliation of its Unstructured ESI. The imposition of an adverse inference instruction on the same basis was appropriate for the same reasons.
[6]  In particular, the district court relied on the Supreme Court's statement in Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1 (1973), that ""a federal court may award counsel fees to a successful party when his opponent has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons."" Id. at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991) (same). The district court found that ePRO had acted with the requisite bad faith here, and that finding was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we have no occasion to address the parties' arguments regarding whether the amendments to Rule 37 that took effect on December 1, 2015 apply to this case.
[7]  For substantially similar reasons, we reject ePRO's argument that the monetary sanctions are punitive measures that violate its due process right. The record makes clear that, consistent with Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger, __ U.S. __, 137 S. Ct. 1178 (2017), the monetary sanctions awarded in this case properly reimbursed Klipsch only for ""the legal bills that [ePRO's] litigation abuse occasioned."" Id. at 1186. Thus, there is no need to consider whether ePRO was provided with the heightened procedural requirements that must be afforded to a litigant before it can be subjected to punitive damages beyond what is required to compensate its opponent. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 416-18 (2003) (explaining the different procedural requirements for compensatory and punitive damages).
[8] Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), which ePRO uses to structure its arguments, seems especially inapt. First, many of the factors enumerated in that case (for example, the novelty and difficulty of the legal issues, whether the fee agreed to by the plaintiff was fixed or contingent, whether the case was unattractive to competent counsel), having been devised for the civil rights fee-shifting context, have little or no relevance to setting an appropriate discovery sanction. See id. at 718-19. Second, the Supreme Court has cast some doubt on whether the Johnson approach remains favored even for fee-shifting cases. See Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, 559 U.S. 542, 550-52 (2010). In any event, although we have sometimes endorsed the Fifth Circuit's approach in other contexts, see, e.g., Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n v. Cty. of Albany & Albany Cty. Bd. of Elections, 522 F.3d 182, 190 (2d Cir. 2008), Johnson is not binding authority in this Circuit.
[9]  Having established that Klipsch reasonably undertook these efforts, we note that ePRO does not argue that Klipsch's counsel and experts charged too much or worked too long on their tasks. Accordingly, there is no reason for us to revisit the district court's careful determination of the proper dollar amount for the sanctions.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Appellee,
v.
JOSEPH TIGANO, III, Defendant-Appellant.[1]
Docket No. 15-3073.
United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.
Argued: October 12, 2017.
Decided: January 23, 2018.
Joseph Tigano, III appeals from his conviction in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Elizabeth A. Wolford, J.) on five counts of drug-related charges, including the manufacture of 1,000 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and § 841(b)(1)(A). Tigano argues that his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial were violated by his nearly seven years of pretrial detention. Because we agree with Tigano that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated, we need not consider his remaining arguments regarding his statutory right to a speedy trial and an alleged Fourth Amendment violation by an aerial infrared scan of his residence. Accordingly, on November 15, 2017, we REVERSED the judgment of the district court and DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE the indictment on all related charges against Tigano. We remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of releasing Tigano and indicated an opinion would follow.
Reversed.
JOSEPH J. KARASZEWSKI, Assistant United States Attorney, for James P. Kennedy, Jr., Acting United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, Buffalo, N.Y., for Appellee.
GARY STEIN (Andrew Gladstein, Andrew Joyce, Stephanie Kelly, on the brief), Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, New York, N.Y., for Defendant-Appellant Joseph Tigano, III.
Before: WINTER, WALKER, and POOLER, Circuit Judges.
POOLER, Circuit Judge.
On July 8, 2008, Joseph Tigano, III and his father, Joseph Tigano, Sr., were arrested on charges related to a marijuana growing enterprise allegedly operated by the two men. When Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA"") task force members executed a search warrant at the Tiganos' residence on the morning of the arrest, they discovered over 1,400 marijuana plants. On October 2, 2008, Tigano and his father were each indicted on six counts. Four of the counts charged drug offenses related to the alleged marijuana growing operation; the remaining two counts charged weapons offenses stemming from firearms found at the residence.
Nearly five years later, on November 25, 2013, Tigano's father pled guilty to one count of manufacturing 50 or more marijuana plants. Tigano refused to accept a plea and proceeded to trial—nearly seven years after his arrest—on May 4, 2015. He was convicted by a jury on May 8, 2015 on five of the six counts in the indictment. Tigano was imprisoned during the entirety of the nearly seven years of pretrial proceedings. On appeal, Tigano argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by an oppressive period of pretrial incarceration. On November 15, 2017, this Court filed an Order that reversed the judgment of the district court and dismissed with prejudice the underlying indictment. We remanded the case for the limited purpose of releasing Tigano from detention and indicated that an opinion would follow. Tigano was released pursuant to that Order on November 15, 2017.
Tigano's facts are exceptional in nearly every meaningful respect within the context of a Sixth Amendment speedy trial analysis. Accordingly, we begin by detailing the circumstances that resulted in Tigano's nearly seven years of pretrial detention. We then offer some historical context for our analysis of this constitutional right in order to better situate Tigano's exceptional facts. Finally, we assess Tigano's delay under the legal framework provided by the Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972).
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The pretrial detention experienced by Joseph Tigano, III appears to be the longest ever experienced by a defendant in a speedy trial case in the Second Circuit. Tigano's experience is an extreme outlier even among the severe examples found within Sixth Amendment case law. Yet no single, extraordinary factor caused the cumulative seven years of pretrial delay. Instead, the outcome was the result of countless small choices and neglects, none of which was individually responsible for the injustice suffered by Tigano, but which together created this extreme instance of a Sixth Amendment violation. A review of the procedural history reveals that Tigano was the victim of poor trial management and general indifference at every level toward this low-priority defendant in a straightforward case.
I. July 8, 2008—April 8, 2009: Arrest, Arraignment, and Hunger Strike
On July 8, 2008, Joseph Tigano, III and his father were arrested. On October 20, 2008, Tigano was arraigned and entered a not guilty plea before Magistrate Judge Hugh Scott. At his arraignment, Tigano (through his then-attorney Thomas Farley) conveyed to the court that he would not accept a plea and wished to preserve his speedy trial rights. The next court meeting on this case was initially scheduled for March 19, 2009, but was rescheduled on motion of Tigano's father, who requested a delay. Tigano's attorney failed to ever convey this change in date to Tigano. When the date of the scheduled conference arrived and no one explained to Tigano why he was not being transported to court, Tigano stopped eating. He later explained to the court that the hunger strike was his response to being left in his jail cell on a scheduled court date with no explanation from his attorney or the court.
II. April 9, 2009—August 11, 2009: First Competency Exam
On April 9, 2009, the parties convened for the delayed status conference. This status conference would result in the first of what would eventually be three court-ordered competency exams, each of which would confirm that Tigano was competent to stand trial. At this juncture in Tigano's pretrial detention, Farley requested a competency evaluation, which was ordered by Magistrate Judge Scott. The transcript of the proceeding makes clear that the driving motivation for the decision to order a competency exam was Tigano's repeated demand for his speedy trial. Tigano's prioritization of a speedy trial appears to have been his primary point of disagreement with Farley and Magistrate Judge Scott explicitly cited Tigano's repeated insistence on a speedy trial as he ordered the competency evaluation. Indeed, Tigano raised his speedy trial rights no fewer than ten times in this single status conference. It was no mystery to any party that Tigano's top priority was moving quickly to trial. Instead, Magistrate Judge Scott ordered a competency exam and, as a result, the next two status conferences were postponed while the court awaited the results of the competency exam.
III. August 12, 2009—January 20, 2010: Unresolved Representation
The parties were finally able to convene for a status conference on August 12, 2009 after Tigano had returned from his competency evaluation. The exam determined that ""he did not suffer from any `major mental illness,' he had a `good understanding of his current legal circumstances' and he was able to `assist properly in his defense.'"" Appellant's Br. at 8. Tigano asked the court for permission to proceed pro se, in large part because of conflicts with Farley regarding Tigano's desire to proceed straight to trial as quickly as possible. The court then engaged Tigano in an extended colloquy, and required the government to recite the possible sentence faced by Tigano if he were convicted. At this first hearing after the competency exam, Magistrate Judge Scott told Tigano that he was making a ""huge mistake"" and that his answers—specifically, his pleas to represent himself so as to proceed quickly to trial—""are tending to make me believe he needs to be evaluated again."" App'x at 129. Magistrate Judge Scott declined to decide on the request to proceed pro se, appointed standby counsel to Tigano to explain the risks to him, and scheduled another status conference for two days later. The second status conference was largely a replay of the first: Tigano's standby counsel again confirmed that Tigano appeared to understand the charges, the government recited the charges Tigano was facing, and Magistrate Judge Scott expressed his skepticism and reserved decision. Nearly one month later, Magistrate Judge Scott granted Tigano's request to proceed pro se. There followed a series of short status conferences, one of which appears to have been scheduled only because Farley failed to appear as directed to hand over files to Tigano at the previous status conference.
It is during this phase of the proceedings that Tigano's statements in court became increasingly desperate and plaintive as he pleaded for the case to move toward resolution. He continued to repeatedly raise his right to a speedy trial and to plead for severance from his father. As Tigano explained to the court, ""What I'm saying is he's a free man. I'm incarcerated. I'm in jail. And my father and his lawyer can actually keep putting motions in to delay this further. I'd like to severance . . ."" App'x at 142. Tigano's father repeatedly moved to delay proceedings. Even so, the court told Tigano that his father had ""caused no delay in your case whatsoever."" App'x at 142.
IV. January 21, 2010—May 16, 2010: Second Competency Exam
When oral argument was eventually held on January 21, 2010, Tigano appeared with his standby counsel, Cheryl Meyers Buth, who would remain his attorney—either stand-by or appointed—for most of the remaining five-plus years of pretrial detention. The scheduled trial date was postponed at the requests of both the father's attorney and the Assistant United States Attorney (""AUSA""), both of whom had other cases on their calendars. When Tigano's attorney addressed the court in this hearing, she first reiterated Tigano's desire for severance and a speedy trial. She next advised the court that
despite the fact that there's been a forensic exam finding that Mr. Tigano is competent to proceed, I have serious reservations about his ability to understand the charges and the procedures and represent himself.
App'x at 225.
This advisement from Tigano's attorney prompted Magistrate Judge Scott to order the second competency exam of Tigano and led Tigano to ask, ""Another one, sir?"" App'x at 229. To be clear, there was no allegation that the first competency exam was defective in any way, nor was there any allegation that there had been a change in Tigano's behavior. Instead, both this second exam and the first exam 281 days earlier appear to have been prompted largely by Tigano's repeated invocation of his speedy trial rights.
At a hearing on March 31, 2010—which Tigano did not attend because he had still not returned from his competency evaluation—the AUSA prosecuting the case acknowledged that Tigano's desire for a speedy trial was part of the rationale for the second competency exam, remarking that ""Mr. Tigano III had been sort of demanding his speedy trial, which is part of the prompting for the Court sending him out for this evaluation."" App'x at 241.
The report for the second competency exam was received by the court on April 14, 2010-83 days after the hearing at which it was ordered—and acknowledged by Magistrate Judge Scott at an April 16, 2010 suppression hearing. Again, the report indicated that Tigano was competent to stand trial. Again, a hearing was delayed at the request of counsel, this time at the requests of counsel for both Tigano and Tigano's father. Again, Magistrate Judge Scott asked the government to submit an order excluding time under the Speedy Trial Act.
V. May 17, 2010—April 4, 2012: Confusion Regarding Multiple Magistrate Judges, Repeated Extensions of Time by Tigano's Father Joined by Tigano's Attorney, and Court Reporter Delays
Over the course of the next nearly two years, Tigano experienced multiple delays stemming primarily from confusion among judges regarding overlapping motions and an erroneous referral order from Judge Skretny. Most significantly, two separate magistrate judges held in abeyance two separate sets of evidentiary motions until Judge Skretny decided appeals regarding portions of the suppression motion initially decided by Magistrate Judge Scott. That decision was finally issued by Judge Skretny on January 19, 2011 as a three-sentence text order nearly six months after the motions were originally decided.
Additional delays during this period resulted from a variety of small neglects. The long-postponed hearing before Magistrate Judge McCarthy was delayed for an additional 40 days because the government failed to produce discovery in a timely manner. The court reporter submitted the transcript of the one-day suppression hearing 117 days after it was held, delaying the progress of the case by nearly four months. Magistrate Judge Scott issued his report and recommendation on December 15, 2011, nearly seven months after the hearing and more than a year and a half after Tigano had filed his motion.
VI. April 5, 2012—January 9, 2014: Plea Negotiations, Crowded Court Docket, Father's Competency Issues, and Adjournments by Counsel
On April 5, 2012, Judge Skretny accepted the reports and recommendations issued by the magistrate judges and advised attorneys that they should submit motions to sever. Tigano's attorney entered no such motion and instead joined the father's request for an adjournment to delay the scheduled status conference. At this point, Tigano entered a new phase of delay caused largely by unsuccessful plea negotiations.
Between the July 10, 2012 status conference—at which Tigano's attorney and the government informed the court that they were involved in plea negotiations —and the father's entry of a plea on November 25, 2013, the court held six status conferences that were each adjourned for one reason or another, each of which reported that Tigano was involved in plea negotiations with the government. A large part of the reason for this period of delay was that the government waited nearly a year to present Tigano a written plea offer. The transcript from the May 28, 2013 status conference indicates that AUSA Thomas S. Duszkiewicz was involved in a major criminal trial and Tigano's case had taken a definitive back seat within the U.S. Attorney's office. Indeed, an AUSA stepped in for Duszkiewicz at the May 28, 2013 status conference, and conceded when questioned about the delay, ""[t]his is definitely not the defense's issue,"" citing Duszkiewicz's lengthy trial and gaps in information within the U.S. Attorney's office as reasons for the delay in the presentation of a written plea. App'x at 661.
When Tigano's attorney finally received the written offer, it was sent to her the day before a scheduled status conference, which resulted in yet another adjournment because she had not yet had an opportunity to present the plea to Tigano. At this status conference, as with several prior conferences, AUSA Duszkiewicz reiterated his view that the plea agreement was a ""two-for-one"" offer, meaning both defendants had to plead for either of them to receive the deal. App'x at 669.
The August 1, 2013 status conference resulted in yet another adjournment, in part so that Tigano's attorney could try to convince him to accept the plea he consistently rejected and ""in part . . . because of [the court's] trial calendar right now."" App'x at 680. When it came time to set trial dates at the September 20, 2013 conference both the government and the court raised scheduling challenges due to congested calendars. On December 16, 2013, the parties met for the final pretrial conference before the trial scheduled for the following day. Yet again, the court delayed the trial, in part to give Tigano time to consider a plea, observing ""You spent some time in jail. I don't think waiting until January is going to really materially affect anything."" App'x at 720.
VII. January 10, 2014—September 2, 2014: Third Competency Exam
On January 10, 2014, Tigano's attorney filed under seal a motion for another competency evaluation of Tigano. This sealed motion included an affidavit from Meyers Buth attesting to her belief that ""in refusing to plead guilty and insisting on his right to a trial, Tigano was acting `imprudent[ly]' and `not in his best interest.'"" Appellant's Br. at 26 (quoting affidavit). Meyers Buth also attached a letter from a private psychologist she retained to evaluate Tigano who also concluded that Tigano was competent to stand trial and explicitly concurred with the two previous competency evaluations.
On January 15, 2014, the parties reconvened for a status conference that would result in Tigano's third court-ordered competency exam. The government supported Meyers Buth's motion at the status conference. The AUSA indicated that he had been prepared at the last status conference ""to suggest that we obviate the need for a hearing and that we send Mr. Tigano out for another examination."" App'x at 766. AUSA Duszkiewicz's rationale for the need for a third court-ordered competency exam was
not necessarily the competency question, but whether there is some other psychological problem that's going to prevent him from understanding the difference between what he potentially looks at as far as a conviction as well as what's being offered by way of this plea.
App'x at 767. In other words, the basis for the competency exam was Tigano's refusal to accept a plea. Judge Skretny referred the matter back to Magistrate Judge Scott while opining that ""whatever time it takes, it takes."" App'x at 769.
As of the March 4, 2014 scheduled status conference—48 days after Judge Skretny referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Scott—the U.S. Marshals Service (""USMS"") still had not transported Tigano to his competency evaluation. Magistrate Judge Scott approved a 15-day extension for the competency exam at the request of the warden of the Metropolitan Correction Center (""MCC"") in New York City, where Tigano was undergoing the evaluation. The warden reported that the MCC was experiencing a ""high volume of cases"" and would not be able to complete the evaluation in time. App'x at 776, 778. The competency evaluation was filed under seal on April 15, 2014. Tigano was briefly under medical hold for some medical issues that arose at MCC, but was released from medical hold on May 2, 2014. The USMS seems to have lost track of Tigano while he was at MCC, such that two pretrial conferences were held without any movement on the case and another was adjourned because Tigano was absent and the date of his return remained uncertain. On July 30, 2014, Tigano finally appeared with Meyers Buth before Magistrate Judge Scott, who accepted the competency determination of this third court-ordered psychological exam. The third competency evaluation established nothing new.
During this period of limbo for Tigano at MCC, he filed a pro se motion styled as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. That motion was received by the court of the Western District of New York on May 12, 2014 and denied by Judge Skretny 15 weeks later, because Judge Skretny refused to consider a pro se motion filed by a represented defendant. The Niagara County jail destroyed all of Tigano's trial-related papers while he was away at MCC.
VIII. September 3, 2014—May 3, 2015: Scheduling Delays for Trial
On September 3, 2014, the parties convened for a pretrial conference and prepared to go to trial with Tigano representing himself and Meyers Buth appearing as standby counsel, given her discomfort with Tigano's preferred trial strategy. At the October 23, 2014 status conference, it was determined that Meyers Buth would indeed represent Tigano at trial.
In anticipation of his March 8, 2015 retirement, Judge Skretny reassigned Tigano's case to Judge Elizabeth Wolford on January 27, 2015. Tigano filed a motion for bail on February 25, 2015, which was denied without prejudice on March 5, 2015. Tigano's jury trial began on May 4, 2015, 6 years, 9 months, and 26 days after his arrest. On May 8, 2015, he was convicted on five drug-related charges and one weapons charge.
DISCUSSION
I. History of the Speedy Trial Right
Recognition of the critical need for criminal defendants to proceed to trial in a timely manner has a long and auspicious history in American law and English common law. The Supreme Court detailed much of this history in its 1967 speedy trial case, Klopfer v. North Carolina, which held that the right applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. 386 U.S. 213, 222-23. The Klopfer Court cited a twelfth-century case from the Assize of Clarendon instructing sheriffs to bring defendants to the traveling justices when the judges ""are not about to come speedily enough into the country where they have been taken"" in order to ensure a prompt trial for the criminal defendants. Id. at 223, n.9 (quoting 2 English Historical Documents 408 (David C. Douglas and G.W. Greenaway eds. 1953)). The Magna Carta incorporates this requirement in its early thirteenth century language establishing basic guarantees of justice: ""We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either justice or right."" Id. at 223 (emphasis added) (quoting Magna Carta, c. 29 (c. 40 of King John's Charter of 1215) (1225), translated and quoted in Sir Edward Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45 (Brooke, 5th ed., 1797) (""Coke's Institutes"")). The early seventeenth century commentaries on English common law by Sir Edward Coke interpreted the Magna Carta's language as guaranteeing to any defendant the right to justice ""speedily without delay."" Id. at 224 (quoting Coke's Institutes 45).
When it came time for the nascent states to draft their own constitutions and declarations of rights, the long-established right to prompt justice was often incorporated. In 1776, both Maryland's Declaration of Rights and Virginia's Bill of Rights included a right to ""a speedy trial by an impartial jury."" Francis H. Heller, The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States: A Study in Constitutional Development 22-23 (1969). Delaware, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania also included the clause in their original state constitutions. Alfredo Garcia, The Sixth Amendment in Modern American Jurisprudence: A Critical Perspective 159, n. 23 (1992). When Anti-Federalists raised concerns regarding a too-strong national government, the remedy adopted by the Constitutional Convention—the Bill of Rights—incorporated the longstanding right to a speedy trial as one of the essential protections of individual rights against the risk of arbitrary governmental power. U.S. Const. amend VI.
""[T]he right to a speedy trial is as fundamental as any of the rights secured by the Sixth Amendment."" Klopfer, 386 U.S. at 223. Its origin in our legal system dates back over 800 years and it was understood as part of the essential safeguards against the newly formed government of the United States. Further, while a defendant may waive his statutory right to a speedy trial by failing to raise it, he cannot waive his constitutional right. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 529-30 (1972).
Though the right may appear abstract and relative, the Supreme Court and this Court have laid out clear methods in determining whether a defendant's constitutional speedy trial right has been violated. We now turn to the controlling law and apply it to the exceptional facts of this case.
II. BARKER v. WINGO
In 1972, the Supreme Court decided Barker v. Wingo, a Sixth Amendment speedy trial case that arose out of a brutal double murder in Christian County, Kentucky. 407 U.S. 514, 516 (1972). Barker, the defendant-appellant before the Supreme Court, was imprisoned for ten months before being released on bond while awaiting trial. Id. at 517. The Supreme Court observed that Barker appeared to be ""gambling"" on the acquittal of his co-defendant, hoping that an acquittal for the co-defendant would make it harder to prosecute him. Id. at 535-36. Over five years passed between Barker's arrest and eventual trial. Id. at 533.
In coming to the conclusion that Barker's speedy trial right had not been violated—the Supreme Court believed the record strongly indicated ""that the defendant did not want a speedy trial,"" id. at 536—the Barker Court established the four-part balancing test that guides our analysis today. Specifically, the Supreme Court identified four key factors: ""[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant."" Id. at 530. In establishing this balancing test, the Barker Court emphasized that:
We regard none of the four factors identified above as either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. In sum, these factors have no talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process. But, because we are dealing with a fundamental right of the accused, this process must be carried out with full recognition that the accused's interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.
Id. at 533.
Consequently, we turn now to an analysis of these four factors with an understanding that no single factor is dispositive and that each serves to guarantee a fundamental, enumerated right of the accused.
A. Length of Delay
""The length of the delay is to some extent a triggering mechanism,"" because until there exists ""some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance."" Id. at 530. Once a delay has been established, ""the burden is upon the government to prove that the delay was justified and that appellant[`s] speedy trial rights were not violated."" United States v. New Buffalo Amusement, Corp., 600 F.2d 368, 377-79 (2d Cir. 1979) (citation omitted). In Buffalo Amusement, appellants experienced a ""54-month delay between indictment and date of trial"" during which time the defendants were free on bond. Id. We found that delay to be ""unquestionably substantial"" and a factor that ""must weigh heavily in support of appellants' claim that their rights have been violated."" Id. at 377.
Tigano's delay—nearly seven years of pretrial detention—is, to our knowledge, the longest delay recorded in the Sixth Amendment case law of our Circuit. Indeed, the government concedes that the length of delay cuts in favor of Tigano. This Court recently affirmed a district court dismissal—also originating in the Western District of New York—on Sixth Amendment speedy trial grounds. United States v. Pennick, No. 16-3069-cr, 2017 WL 4994465 (2d Cir. Nov. 2, 2017) (summary order). The defendant in Pennick had been subjected to ""fifty-four months in pretrial detention and twenty-five months on electronically-monitored home incarceration,"" which we deemed ""extraordinary."" Id. at *1-*2. Tigano's extreme facts thus force the government to account for its delay and ""prove that the delay was justified and that [Tigano's] speedy trial rights were not violated."" Buffalo Amusement, 600 F.2d at 377. The extreme length of delay thus weighs heavily against the government.
B. Reasons for Delay
The Barker Court instructed that ""different weights should be assigned to different reasons."" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Barker established a spectrum of weights, in which ""deliberate"" attempts to delay trial weighed most heavily against the government, ""valid"" reasons for delay such as missing witnesses are taken off the scale entirely, and reasons of ""negligence or overcrowded dockets"" are weighted somewhere in the middle, because ""the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant."" Id. This factor must take into account the affirmative duty of the district court and the government to monitor the progress of a criminal case toward disposition and to take steps to avoid unnecessary delay where possible. ""We have repeatedly emphasized that affirmative action by the government in bringing cases to trial is mandated and that it cannot escape this duty on the ground that the delay is for institutional reasons."" United States v. Vispi, 545 F.2d 328, 334 (2d Cir. 1976) (citation omitted). Incredibly, the government contends that ""none of the delay is attributable to the government.""[2] Appellee's Br. at 26.
The reasons for the delay in this case were largely due to: 1) the needlessly repetitive and dilatory competency examinations, all of which found Tigano competent; 2) administrative delays, including the delay in conducting the third court-ordered competency hearing (itself unnecessary in light of the two prior court-ordered exams and hearings) because the USMS failed to provide timely transportation; 3) the government's failure for months to produce a written plea offer, despite the age of the case, and its insistence on consolidating the case and plea bargaining with Tigano's father; 4) the district court's congested docket and failure to give this case priority; 5) the use of multiple magistrate judges resulting in confusion regarding responsibility and one judge having to await rulings by another; and 6) defense counsel's desire to delay the trial in hopes of a favorable plea, notwithstanding Tigano's express desire to proceed quickly to trial.
1. Competency Evaluations
We first turn to the most complex set of facts for the delay, namely, the three separate competency exams ordered by the magistrate judge. Each of these exams—and an additional exam conducted by a private psychologist retained by Tigano's attorney—concluded that Tigano was fully competent to stand trial. There is no evidence in the record—either in open court or in documents filed under seal—that any party or officer of the court had any concerns about the quality or legitimacy of any one of these exams. And while the exams suggest that Tigano may have an eccentric personality, they each clearly state that he understood the charges against him and was capable of aiding in his own defense.
Indeed, the examinations are strikingly consistent with one another in their assessment that Tigano clearly understood what was happening and was capable of assisting in his own defense. Yet all parties involved—the court, the government, and Tigano's own attorney—participated in steering him through three court-ordered exams. The details of each of those decisions have already been recounted, but it is worth reiterating the truly remarkable fact that for both the second and third court-ordered exams, the government acknowledged in open court that at least part of the motivation for the exam was Tigano's assertion of his speedy trial right and his refusal to accept a plea, respectively. No party argued that there was new information or a change in circumstances to justify yet another exam and attendant delay.
Motions for mental competency determinations are made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4241(a), which permits defense or government attorneys to move for a hearing on competency which ""[t]he court shall grant . . . if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense."" Court-ordered psychological exams for the purposes of determining competency prior to the hearing are permitted under 18 U.S.C. 4241(b).
It was error for the district court to send Tigano out for evaluation by a third court-appointed psychologist simply because he refused to accept a plea, when that was the only evidence of ""incompetency"" before the district court and three separate psychologists (two who were court-ordered and one who was privately retained) had already attested to his competency to stand trial and assist in his own defense, as acknowledged by the magistrate judge who issued the order. We thus count these delays against the government.
2. Administrative Delays
Tigano's trial date was also delayed by the USMS and the court reporters in the Western District of New York. Tigano's third court-ordered competency evaluation resulted in a seven-month delay (January 2014 — July 2014)—double the combined length of the first two court-ordered competency evaluations. This delay appears to have been due to the USMS's failure to provide timely transportation to and from the site of the examination. Both the court and the government should have monitored the situation and prevented the delay. See United States v. Carini, 562 F.2d 144, 149-50 (2d Cir. 1977) (""While it is . . . true that `institutional' delays are not counted as heavily against the government as are delays caused or encouraged by the prosecution for tactical reasons,"" delays ""occasioned by . . . unexplained inaction of the District Court, caused, no doubt, by an overloaded docket . . . are properly chargeable against the government under prevailing case law."") (collecting cases). Specifically, when the court granted the request for the third competency evaluation, it should have issued a time limit and instructed the parties to be ready for trial when Tigano was found competent yet again.
Tigano's trial was also delayed by the court reporters of the Western District of New York. At one point, both defendants were forced to wait 117 days for a transcript of a one-day suppression motion, because they were ordered to file their submissions within 30 days of receiving that transcript. At many points along the way, transcripts arrived only after long delays.[3] Administrative delays are counted against the government, since it is not the defendant's responsibility to monitor the speed at which court reporters produce transcripts or at which USMS provides court-ordered transportation.
3. Plea Negotiations
Initial plea negotiations consumed approximately one year, which we have held is time that must be counted against the government. See, e.g., Buffalo Amusement, 600 F.2d at 378 (""Good faith plea negotiations by a defendant should not be equated to a waiver of speedy trial rights, and, under the circumstances, the government must assume responsibility for the risk of institutional delays where the bargain ultimately is unsuccessful.""). It is particularly appropriate to construe the time against the government in this case because it took the government nearly a year to actually present a written plea offer to Tigano. When it finally presented the plea offer, it did so on the night before the scheduled conference, forcing Meyers Buth to request a 30-day continuance because she had not had any opportunity to review the plea offer with Tigano.
We additionally observe that the district court should have set a firm cutoff date for plea negotiations rather than allow them to drag on for one-and-a-half years. Indeed, about ten months into the plea negotiations—and we qualify the word ""negotiations"" because Tigano had made clear from the time of his arraignment that he had no interest in a plea—the government informed the court that it had yet to present a written offer to Tigano. At that point, the district court should have ordered the government to present its plea offer within a reasonable number of days, and scheduled a trial after a brief period for negotiations. Moreover, some of the delay was caused by the government's insistence on joint negotiations with Tigano's father.
We have held that the time spent in plea bargaining is a gamble taken by the government regarding the defendant's speedy trial rights and is properly counted against the government. See Buffalo Amusement, 600 F.2d at 378. The government obliquely asserts that the process of plea bargaining counts against Tigano, but this is incorrect. The substantial delay caused by the government's failure to timely produce a written plea offer, its obstinacy in insisting on a joint resolution, and the court's failure to monitor the endless delays occasioned by the ""negotiations"" are all attributed to the government.
4. District Court Congestion
Delays due to ""overcrowded courts,"" are counted against the government. Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. It is clear that court congestion—and a failure of the court to prioritize this long-lingering criminal case—contributed to the substantial delay faced by Tigano. For example, even though its calendar was congested, the court could have set a trial date when Tigano's attorney informed the court that plea negotiations had failed and that she was ready to proceed to trial on October 23, 2014, over six months before the trial ultimately commenced. Considering that this was a 2008 criminal case and that Tigano was incarcerated throughout the entire pretrial period, the court should have given priority to this case. Additional delays were caused by the court's crowded docket, for example, at the August 1, 2013 and September 20, 2013 status conferences, when the court conceded that adjournments were being granted in part to accommodate the court's congested calendar. At the time of those status conferences, Tigano had already been detained for over five years. It is difficult to imagine a case that would have warranted scheduling priority over Tigano, yet time and again this low-priority case took a backseat to competing demands. Again, we conclude that this time must be counted against the government.
5. District Court Use of Magistrate Judges
On May 17, 2010, the magistrate judge who had been handling all of the nearly two years of pretrial activity properly recused himself from the suppression motion, because he had been the issuing magistrate of the search warrant. Rather than deciding the suppression motion itself and sending it back to the same magistrate, however, the district court split the motions and sent them to two separate magistrates, despite the fact that they involved the same set of facts. The motions were further delayed because of confusion among the magistrates about who had authority over which issues, so that the magistrates sat on their respective motions until the discovery appeal was determined by the district court. In the end, Tigano spent two years in jail while this confusion was sorted out.
There is no evidence the government was deliberately dilatory in its handling of these motions. Instead, the delay seems attributable to a series of misunderstandings and delays, as well as some poor decisions by the district court regarding court efficiency. However, Barker makes clear that ""neutral"" delays must be considered ""since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant."" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531.
6. Dilatory Tactics of Defense Counsel
Despite Tigano's repeated demands for a speedy trial, his attorney requested multiple extensions and failed to urge the district court to set a trial date. It seems likely that she wanted Tigano to plead to the reduced charge and was repeatedly frustrated by Tigano's continued refusal to consider a plea and insistence on going to trial. Indeed, Tigano's attorney requested several delays for the purpose of trying to convince Tigano to accept a plea, requested or caused other delays because of her discomfort with Tigano's trial strategy, and generally acceded to the requests for delays by Tigano's father, rather than asserting Tigano's right to a speedy trial or his desire for severance.
Though her intentions may have been admirable, it is a bedrock rule of professional conduct that the decision to accept or reject a plea is ultimately a decision made by the client. See, e.g., American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct R. 1.2(a). It is also fundamental that an attorney may not coerce a client into accepting a plea. Purdy v. U.S., 208 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir. 2000). This Court has explicitly instructed lower courts that:
[T]he defendant and not the court should decide what strategy should be pursued to adequately protect the defendant's interest. To take this choice out of his hands would deprive him of the right to conduct his defense in his manner and in accordance with his own standards.
U.S. v. Anderson, 394 F.2d 743, 748 (2d Cir. 1968). In the same vein, we have previously held that, ""[i]t is the role of the lawyer to be a professional advisor and advocate, not to usurp his client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation."" U.S. v. Wellington, 417 F.3d 284, 289 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal citations and punctuation omitted). It would be improper to count these delays against the objecting defendant, and we decline to do so in this case.
It will be an exceptional case where, as here, a delay caused by a defense attorney counts against the government, under the Barker analysis, and not the defense. Unless the record shows otherwise, we normally presume that a defense attorney is carrying out his or her client's chosen trial strategy and that any delays resulting from that strategy count against the defendant.
C. Defendant's Assertion of the Right
We also must consider the defendant's own assertion of his right to a speedy trial. ""The defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right . . . is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right."" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-32. On this factor, Tigano's case again presents exceptional facts.
Tigano adamantly, consistently, and explicitly raised his speedy trial rights at nearly every appearance he made before the court. At his October 20, 2008 arraignment, Tigano's attorney at the time told the district court, ""He also had indicated to me that he does not wish to waive his speedy trial rights."" App'x at 56. At his next appearance on April 9, 2009, when the district court asked Tigano about a delay for a competency evaluation in the wake of his hunger strike, Tigano explained to the district court, ""Sir, I mentioned it the last time I was in court, I don't want to waive my right to a speedy trial. And that—that's my main concern."" App'x at 68. During this same hearing, the district court instructed Tigano's attorney that there was no need to add a written statement to the record regarding Tigano's desire for a speedy trial because ""he's already stated that on the record, and he thinks it's necessary to do it by writing. It's on the record, leave it there."" App'x at 79. This pattern continued nearly every time Tigano appeared before the district court, to the extent that the government observed at a March 31, 2010 hearing that the repeated speedy trial demands were part of the reason for the district court's decision to have Tigano's competency evaluated. App'x at 241 (""Mr. Tigano III had been sort of demanding his speedy trial, which is part of the prompting for the Court sending him out for this evaluation.""). Incredibly, the government now argues that Tigano made no formal assertion of his speedy trial right for purposes of the Sixth Amendment analysis. We dismiss that argument as implausible based on the facts and inapposite based on the law; a defendant may waive his statutory right to a speedy trial by failing to formally raise it, but not his constitutional right. Barker, 407 U.S. at 529-30 (""We, therefore, reject . . . the demand-waiver rule because it is insensitive to a right which we have deemed fundamental. The approach we accept is a balancing test, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed."")
Tigano requested his speedy trial so frequently and vociferously that it is simply inconceivable the government was not ""put on notice"" that this issue would resurface if Tigano's speedy trial rights were not protected. Buffalo Amusement, 600 F.2d at 378. Having offered this analysis, we do not mean to suggest that the words ""speedy trial"" ought to function as a magical incantation that guarantee an immediate trial to any defendant who so wishes. We acknowledge that there are many legitimate reasons why trials may be delayed. Nor do we expect every defendant to raise the issue as frequently as Tigano in order to preserve his right to a speedy trial. On this point we reiterate that the right to a speedy trial is a right explicitly enumerated in the Sixth Amendment. A defendant's lack of vigor in pursuing this right—or his deliberately dilatory behavior in forestalling trial—are factors to be considered in our analysis, buta defendant's failure to formally raise the right via motion does not necessarily count against the defendant, as the government argues it should. The speedy trial right is guaranteed to all defendants by the Sixth Amendment and its precise contours are determined by courts on an ""ad hoc basis"" considering the facts of each case, including the defendant's invocation of that right. Barker, 407 U.S. at 530. Formal procedural requirements are out of place in this context.
We also observe that this case raises a new wrinkle to the fact patterns of the speedy trial cases in our Circuit. While Tigano himself made very clear that he desired a speedy trial, this desire was not always echoed by or reflected in the choices made by his attorney. These facts are unusual in this area of law and distinguish this case from others within this Circuit's speedy trial jurisprudence. Accordingly, we conclude that in the context of a speedy trial action such as this one, a defendant's assertion of his own right to a speedy trial—even though ignored or contravened by his counsel—is the relevant fact for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis. Quite simply, the right to a speedy trial belongs to the defendant, not to defendant's counsel.[4]
D. Prejudice to the Defendant
The last Barker factor to examine is the prejudice to the defendant occasioned by the delay. Prejudice should be assessed in regard to those interests the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is designed to protect, namely, ""(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired."" Barker, 407 U.S. at 532. While the last factor is ""the most serious,"" it is only one of three interests protected by the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial. Id. Affirmative proof of impairment of the defense is not required in order to find a Sixth Amendment violation. See, e.g., Doggett v. U.S., 505 U.S. 647, 655 (1992) (""affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim"") (citation omitted).
Tigano was severely prejudiced in terms of the first two factors. His nearly seven years of pretrial incarceration were egregiously oppressive; we reiterate that this appears to be the longest period of pretrial incarceration we have seen in a speedy trial context in this Circuit. In addition to the sheer passage of time, his confinement in local jails makes those years particularly oppressive. The Barker Court noted that ""[m]ost jails offer little or no recreational or rehabilitative programs. The time spent in jail is simply dead time."" Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33. Nearly seven years of pretrial detention in local jails—before the defendant has been convicted of any crime—is precisely the type of prejudice contemplated by the right to a speedy trial. Tigano amply demonstrates prejudice on this point.
The second interest protected by the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is the interest in minimizing the ""anxiety and concern"" of the accused. Id., 407 U.S. at 532. On this point, Tigano was severely prejudiced. Tigano repeatedly expressed his anxiety to the district court and explicitly cited that anxiety as the primary motivation for his desire for a speedy trial:
Basically time is going by, and more time goes on I'm just—how would you say, just moving on in the past. Longer this takes, harder it is to remember everything that's happens. [sic] The sooner it happens, the better.
App'x at 127-28.
Tigano told the district court he wanted to proceed pro se because ""[i]t will just resolve this matter, sir."" App'x at 150. He later expressed his anxieties by explaining
[t]hat's why I was trying to go with the speedy trial thing, knowing that, if anything, my dad, if he can't stick around here, maybe he'd stay with my mother, in, you know, the other part of New York, eastern New York. Otherwise, I'm hoping to push things ahead. This way however— whatever gets determined, I'm more, how would you say, everything has been taken away from me. So to me, whatever you guys want me to have, or do, I'm trying to bring right to the front, and go with it.
App'x at 213. Tigano made clear that he preferred to have the matter decided rather than living with the anxiety and uncertainty of charges hanging over his head. Nearly seven years of delay in a trial the AUSA described as ""very simple,"" App'x at 829, imposes an inexcusable amount of anxiety on the unconvicted defendant. This anxiety is the type of prejudice the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was designed to prevent.
E. Balancing Test
Weighing the four Barker factors leads us to the inescapable conclusion that Tigano's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by his nearly seven years of pretrial incarceration. The reasons for delay fall largely on the district court and government attorneys. Tigano's repeated assertions of his right to a speedy trial place him on the extreme end of our Circuit's case law. His repeated pleas for trial also speak to the fourth and final prong, the prejudice suffered by Tigano in the form of anxiety and the oppressiveness of his lengthy period of pretrial incarceration. The only remedy is to dismiss the case with prejudice, Strunk v. U.S., 412 U.S. 434, 440 (1973), which we did via court order on November 15, 2017.
CONCLUSION
We reiterate that the nearly seven years of pretrial detention in this case, as well as Tigano's single-minded focus on obtaining a speedy trial, present extreme facts in the speedy trial context. In other words, these facts represent what we expect will be a ceiling, rather than a floor, for Sixth Amendment analysis. Yet the case is no less significant because of its outlier status. Years of subtle neglects resulted in a flagrant violation of Tigano's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. On January 21, 2010, the slow progression of the case left Tigano to reflect that ""[s]o much time has gone by."" App'x at 225. He would wait another 1,929 days—over 5 years—before his case would eventually proceed to trial. Tigano's years of imprisonment represent a failure of our courts to comply with their obligation to bring defendants to ""a speedy and public trial."" U.S. Const. amend. VI.
Because we find that Tigano's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated, we need not consider Tigano's remaining claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the indictment is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
[1]  The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the caption as above.
[2]  We observe that the same U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of New York made the same extraordinary claim in Pennick, which we found unpersuasive in that case, as well. Pennick, at *2. [Brief for Appellant, 16-3069-cr (2d Cir. Feb. 24, 2017) (ECF No. 27 at 16) (""[N]one of the delay is attributable to the government."")].
[3]  We observe that many of the transcripts filed in this case were significantly and inexplicably delayed. The transcript of the September 4, 2008 preliminary exam for both defendants was filed 186 days later and the transcript of May 27, 2010 oral argument on pretrial motions took 139 days to file. Transcripts filed after trial were even more egregiously delayed, ranging from 205 days for the filing of the sentencing hearing to an outrageous 2,194 days—or, 6 years and 2 days—for the October 20, 2008 arraignment. Transcripts are essential tools to advocates in the course of trial preparation and trial, as well as on appeal. These delays are suggestive of substantial problems regarding the ability of criminal defendants to obtain transcripts in the Western District of New York.
[4]  The Seventh Circuit has observed that ""the right is ill-suited to rigid forfeiture rules,"" and that Barker's balancing of the defendant's assertion of the right is the better approach. United States v. Oriedo, 498 F.3d 593, 596 (7th Cir. 2007). The Ninth Circuit has similarly rejected rigid forfeiture rules in a statutory context under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. 3161 et seq. See, e.g., United States v. Hall, 181 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (9th Cir. 1999) (""[W]here defense counsel does not assert his client's right to a speedy trial, a defendant may alert the court directly of his desire not to waive those rights."").

Decided: January 3, 2018.
Plaintiff-appellant Wandering Dago, Inc., (""WD"") operates a food truck and brands itself and the food it sells with language generally viewed as ethnic slurs. Defendants-appellees are officials within the New York State Office of General Services (""OGS"") who played a part in repeatedly denying WD's applications to participate as a food truck vendor in the Summer Outdoor Lunch Program (""Lunch Program"") that is organized by OGS and takes place in Albany's Empire State Plaza during the summer months. WD contends that defendants violated its rights under the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, and the New York State Constitution by denying WD's application because of its ethnic-slur branding.
We conclude that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in defendants' favor, and should instead have awarded judgment to WD. It is undisputed that defendants denied WD's applications solely because of its ethnic-slur branding. As the Supreme Court recently clarified in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), such an action amounts to viewpoint discrimination and is prohibited by the First Amendment. That these acts violated the First Amendment leads to the conclusion that defendants further violated WD's equal protection rights and rights under the New York State Constitution. On the facts before us, we find unpersuasive defendants' argument that their actions were unobjectionable because they were either part of OGS's government speech or permissible regulation of a government contractor's speech.
For these reasons, the District Court's judgment is REVERSED and the cause is REMANDED for the entry of a revised judgment consistent with this opinion.

SUSAN L. CARNEY, Circuit Judge.
Plaintiff-appellant Wandering Dago, Inc., (""WD"") operates a food truck and brands itself and the food it sells with language generally viewed as ethnic slurs. Defendants-appellees (""defendants"")[1] are officials within the New York State Office of General Services (""OGS"") who played a part in twice denying WD's applications to participate as a food vendor in the Summer Outdoor Lunch Program (""Lunch Program""), an activity that is organized by OGS and takes place in Albany's Empire State Plaza annually in the summer months. WD contends that defendants violated its rights to free speech and equal protection under the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution by denying WD's application because of its branding practices.
We conclude that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in defendants' favor, and should instead have awarded judgment to WD. It is undisputed that defendants denied WD's applications solely because of its ethnic-slur branding. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), clarifies that this action amounts to viewpoint discrimination and, if not government speech or otherwise protected, is prohibited by the First Amendment. That the action violates the First Amendment leads directly to the conclusion that defendants also violated WD's equal protection rights and its rights under the New York State Constitution. We find unpersuasive defendants' argument that their actions were unobjectionable because they were either part of OGS's government speech or permissible regulation of a government contractor's speech.
For these reasons, the District Court's judgment is REVERSED and the cause is REMANDED for the entry of a revised judgment consistent with this opinion.
BACKGROUND[2]
WD is a New York corporation owned and operated by Andrea Loguidice and Brandon Snooks. WD operates a food truck using the ""Wandering Dago"" brand, serving food for a variety of functions, including catering events, fairs and festivals, and street-side lunch service. Loguidice and Snooks declare that they view their food truck as ""the people's truck"" and as giving a ""nod to [their] Italian heritage"" and to their ancestors, who immigrated to the United States as day laborers. App. 73, 169. Using ethnic slurs in the names of their business and of the food that they sell reflects that philosophy, in their view. WD characterizes this practice as ""signaling an irreverent, blue collar solidarity with its customers"" and ""signal[ing] to . . . immigrant groups that this food truck is for them."" Appellant's Br. 3, 39. It notes that using slurs in this way can ""weaken the derogatory force"" of the slur or ""convey affiliation with . . . members of that minority group."" Id. at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted).
OGS is a department of the New York State government. It is charged with managing and leasing real property, building and maintaining state facilities, contracting for goods and services on behalf of the State, and providing other administrative support services. Defendant-appellee RoAnn M. Destito is the Commissioner of OGS. Defendant-appellee Joseph J. Rabito was the Executive Deputy Commissioner of OGS. Defendant-appellee William F. Bruso, Jr., is an associate attorney working for OGS, and defendant-appellee Aaron Walters is employed by OGS as a promotions and public affairs agent.
Empire State Plaza, in Albany, is owned by the State of New York and operated by OGS. The Plaza incorporates multiple state buildings, including the Corning Tower, four agency buildings, the Swan Street Building, the Legislative Office Building, the Robert Abrams Justice Building, the Egg Center for Performing Arts (the ""Egg""), the Cultural Education Center (which contains the State Museum and the State Library), and the New York State Capitol Building, all of which are connected by an underground public concourse. The ""Plaza level"" of the Empire State Plaza is an open outdoor space featuring a central reflecting pool. This outdoor area, on its own, is also sometimes referred to as the Empire State Plaza. For our purposes, we use the term ""Empire State Plaza"" or simply the ""Plaza"" to refer solely to the outdoor area that is at issue in this case.
The Plaza is the site of a farmer's market on certain weekdays during the summer. Annually, several state-organized events are held in the space. These include the African American Family Day, the Hispanic Heritage Month celebration, the Food Festival, and the Fourth of July Festival. Subject to a permitting requirement, the Plaza is also occasionally used by various private groups as a site for political rallies, marches, and protests. OGS does not use the potential offensiveness of a political event as a basis for denying an application for the requisite event permit, and it does not review signs and speeches to be displayed as part of such an event in advance.
Although OGS issues permits to individuals and organizations that apply for permission to demonstrate on OGS-controlled property, including the Plaza, some demonstrations are allowed to occur without a permit, unless they present a disruption or a health or safety issue. According to OGS, the purpose of the permitting process ""is to provide OGS with notice of the likely size and location of the demonstration so that OGS can provide adequate services and operational management."" App. 1013. Demonstrations also occur on the concourse beneath the Plaza, some with permits and some without.
Defendants contend, but WD disputes, that OGS has a consistent policy of allowing only ""family-friendly"" events on the Plaza when OGS is operating the event. App. 1027. Deputy Commissioner Rabito says that during African American Family Day 2010, he directed an OGS employee not to hire one of the proposed dance troupes because its dress and type of dance were deemed not family-friendly. And OGS once removed a singer from the stage during a similar event for using the n-word. Rabito asserts that, ""during the course of an OGS-sponsored event on the Plaza, OGS has directed vendors that are permitted to sell products at the Plaza as part of OGS-sponsored events or programs to remove items from their stalls that violated OGS's family-friendly [policy], including replica `black face' figurines, panties with `Kiss Me I'm Irish' printed on them, fertility pendants with a phallus that becomes erect when a chain is pulled, and marijuana leaf belt buckles."" App. 395.
In the spring of 2013, OGS began planning a program that would, daily, allow a limited number of vendors to sell food items from trucks parked at designated spots on the East Roadway, located on the east side of the Plaza, between the reflecting pool and the Egg. In prior years, a single private company under contract with the state, Sodexo, had provided food services for an outdoor lunch program, but Sodexo's contract was not renewed for 2013.
Under the new Lunch Program, OGS grants permits to qualified food vendors to participate in providing food during lunchtime hours to state employees as well as to visitors who come to the Capitol and adjacent state buildings and parks in the summer and early fall months. The Lunch Program requires vendors seeking to participate to apply to OGS for a permit. OGS determines the applicant's eligibility to participate.
The application for the 2013 Lunch Program informed vendors of several OGS policies. Because of their importance, we reproduce many of those policies here verbatim, notwithstanding their combined length. They included the following:
• The Office of General Services is soliciting food vendors for the 2013 Empire State Plaza (ESP) Summer Outdoor Lunch Program to be held daily on the Plaza at the Empire State Plaza in Albany, New York. The 20 week season will run from Monday, May 20th through Friday, October 4th.
• The Summer Outdoor Lunch Program Package includes: [among other things] 20 feet of vending space which includes electrical hookup and access to water. . . .
• The cost for full participation, 5 days a week for 20 weeks, is $1,500.00; participation on Wednesdays and Fridays only, for 20 weeks, is $1,000.00. All fees are due with your completed application no later than May 10, 2013. Interested parties must apply for a vending permit and meet all insurance and financial requirements in order to participate in the 2013 ESP Outdoor Lunch Program.
• Vendors will not be allowed to provide vending services at the Empire State Plaza until they are in receipt of written approval of their application to participate in the Outdoor Lunch Program.
• Unless prior arrangements have been made with OGS, all vendors are expected to complete the entire season.
• Vending hours are from 9:00 a.m. — 2:00 p.m. Vendors are not allowed to sell prior to or after these hours.
• Each vendor will be assigned a specific vending location; all space assignment will be at the discretion of OGS.
• The sale or distribution of products other than food or beverage items is prohibited.
• Vendors may only sell menu items approved by the Albany County Department of Health and permitted per the Vendor's vending permit for the ESP Outdoor Lunch Program. Vendors wishing to add additional items to their menu must request approval from the Albany County Department of Health and provide OGS' Bureau of Food Services with a copy of the revised permit. OGS reserves the right to prohibit the sale, display or distribution of certain items if, in its sole opinion, these items may reasonably cause concern such as public safety.
• All vendors are expected to conduct themselves with courtesy and in an orderly manner. Arguments, harassment, sexual harassment, name-calling, profane language, or fighting are grounds for revocation of the vendor permit.
• OGS reserves the right to change the location, dates, hours, or to terminate entirely the operation of the program at any time and without prior notice to the vendor.
• Vendors will not refer to themselves as ""sponsor,"" ""co-sponsor"" or other terms conferring status other than of a participant.
App. 401-03 (underscoring in original).
Applicants to the 2013 Lunch Program also signed a ""Plaza Vendor Permit Agreement for Empire State Plaza Vendors,"" agreeing to abide by the rules set forth above (among others). The permit agreement's preamble contained the following language:
WHEREAS, OGS has management supervision over the general domain of the food service operations at the Empire State Plaza (hereinafter referred to as ""Plaza""),
WHEREAS, the State is interested in having food vendors take part in a lunchtime food vending program for the sale and distribution of food/beverage products and services[,]
WHEREAS, OGS will be operating such a food vending program, by subcontracting some or all of the responsibilities therefor[] to various independent food vendors, and
WHEREAS, the Vendor wishes to sell these products in those areas and during those times OGS hereinafter designates.
App. 407.
The Lunch Program was instituted to provide lunch options to government employees and visitors. Defendants contend more specifically, but WD disputes, that the Lunch Program ""was created as an extension of the cafeteria services at the [Plaza] in order to meet the practical need to provide summer outdoor lunch options, to the approximately 11,000 State employees who work at ESP, as well as visitors to the Capitol, State Museum, performing arts center (The Egg), and the various monuments and memorial[s] at [the Plaza]."" App. 1026.
Defendants claim that OGS informed the public about the Lunch Program in several different ways. For example, it advertised the Lunch Program on a closed-circuit television system located throughout Empire State Plaza's concourse, but without listing the names of the vendors. It promoted the Lunch Program on its Facebook page and other social media websites. And it publicized the Program on a food critic's blog.
On February 27, 2013, Loguidice contacted OGS to inquire about WD's possible participation in the 2013 Lunch Program. On May 10, 2013, Aaron Walters of OGS left a voicemail message for Loguidice, advising her that WD could apply. On May 17, 2013, Loguidice faxed WD's application to OGS. WD's application included its proposed menu, which featured sandwiches with the following names: ""Dago,"" ""Castro,"" ""American Idiot,"" ""Goombah,"" ""Guido,"" ""Polack,"" ""El Guapo,"" and ""KaSchloppas."" App. 1034. Loguidice neglected to include the application's Appendix B, which is designed to contain the vendor's contact information and tax identification number, and a description of the type of vending operation, the space required, the applicant's electrical needs, and other details. At least ten other vendors applied to participate in the 2013 Program.
Soon after receiving WD's application, OGS officials approached Deputy Commissioner Rabito, seeking his views on WD's proposed participation in the 2013 Lunch Program. According to Rabito, he recognized the term ""dago"" as ""a highly offensive term for Italians and his initial reaction was that the application would not be approved."" App. 1034-35. Rabito recounted that he then conducted a computer search of the term ""dago,"" which not only confirmed (he said) that it is an offensive derogatory term, but also revealed that it has been used to refer to people of Spanish and Portuguese descent, in addition to Italians. In addition, Rabito declared that he searched WD's website and saw that other offensive names appeared on its menu.
It is undisputed that Rabito thereafter denied WD's application solely because of those offensive terms, and not on other possible grounds such as the application's incompleteness. Defendants characterize Rabito's act as a denial ""on the grounds that its name contains an offensive ethnic slur and does not fit with OGS' policy of providing family-friendly programming."" App. 1035. WD characterizes the act as a denial merely on the ground that Rabito found its branding ""offensive,"" without reference to ""any statute[,] regulation, policy, or other source of guidance in making his decision."" Id.
Later on the day of Rabito's denial, OGS advised all applicants other than WD that their applications to participate in the 2013 Lunch Program had been accepted. Among the vendors accepted was a truck named ""Slidin' Dirty,"" a slang reference, apparently, both to small hamburgers and to the act of driving while in possession of drugs or firearms. App. 1036-37.[3] Although none dispute that Rabito's decision rested solely on WD's offensive branding, when OGS formally notified WD of its permit denial on May 20, 2013, it cited as reasons both WD's offensive name and its failure to submit a complete application before the stated deadline. OGS approved other applications that were late and/or incomplete, however.
In the fall of 2013, OGS adopted a new procedure to assess the applications of outside vendors seeking to participate in its events and programs. Under the new procedure, each event or program would have a set of explicit criteria by which applications would be scored, and explicit scoring cutoffs to determine which applicants would be accepted.
On May 5, 2014, WD submitted a timely and complete application for the 2014 Lunch Program. The application was reviewed by OGS employees designated as the selection committee, was scored, and received a score sufficient for acceptance into the program. Nevertheless, the application was denied. WD received a letter dated May 16, 2014, from Bruso, advising it that its application had been denied ""due to your firm's name as previously described."" App. 659, 1018. Among the eight complete applications submitted that year, WD's was the only one not accepted.
WD filed this section 1983 lawsuit on August 27, 2013. In its amended complaint, WD alleges that OGS officials violated its rights to free speech and equal protection under the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution by denying its application for a vendor permit in the 2013 and 2014 Lunch Programs on the basis of its branding. WD seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, along with attorney's fees. It has abandoned its claim for money damages.
The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and in March 2016, the District Court denied WD's motion, granted the defense's motion, and entered judgment in favor of defendants Bruso, Destito, Rabito, and Walters. Wandering Dago, Inc. v. Destito, No. 1:13-CV-1053, 2016 WL 843374 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2016). The District Court rejected WD's argument that its speech—again, the name of its truck and food offerings—was protected by the commercial speech doctrine. Rather, it concluded that WD's speech must be considered either government speech, speech by a government contractor, or private speech in a government-owned forum, as to which the First Amendment's protections would not prevent OGS's denial. Unsure of which category applied, the court concluded that WD's claim failed under each. It also rejected WD's federal equal protection claim and the parallel free speech and equal protection claims under the New York State Constitution.
WD timely appealed.
DISCUSSION
WD argues that branding its business with language commonly viewed as ethnic slurs while participating in the Lunch Program at the Empire State Plaza is a form of commercial speech in a quintessential public forum, and that therefore OGS's actions must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. Further, WD contends that, regardless of the forum's nature, defendants violated its First Amendment rights by discriminating against its viewpoint, and necessarily also its equal protection rights and rights under the New York State Constitution. It challenges OGS's contention that defendants' actions constituted government speech or regulation of a government contractor's speech, as well as the permissibility of the District Court's sua sponte addressing those issues. In addition, WD argues that the standard by which OGS decision-makers evaluated Lunch Program applications allowed defendants, unconstitutionally, to impose prior restraints at their discretion.
While not disputing that WD's use of ethnic slurs in the branding of its food truck is a form of speech, defendants counter that the Lunch Program is a nonpublic forum; that commercial speech doctrine does not apply to speech made in this context; and that prohibiting the use of ethnic slurs is a reasonable and viewpoint-neutral regulation. Turning to the issue of discretion, defendants argue that OGS's asserted ""family-friendly"" policy, in both its written and unwritten expressions, sufficiently circumscribes its decision-makers' discretion in evaluating Lunch Program applications to survive constitutional challenge. They also maintain that their actions were part of OGS's government speech, or at least regulation of a government contractor's speech, and are therefore not subject to the same degree of First Amendment scrutiny as restrictions on private speech. Finally, on the same reasoning, they contend that WD's equal protection and New York State Constitution claims fail.
For the reasons set out below, we conclude that the District Court should have granted summary judgment in WD's favor and not for defendants. By rejecting WD's application only on the ground of its branding, defendants impermissibly discriminated against WD's viewpoint and therefore ran afoul of the First Amendment, whether WD's speech is categorized as commercial speech, speech in a public forum, or speech in a nonpublic forum. See Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017). Defendants' actions are not shielded by doctrines applicable to government speech and government contractor speech. Although bearing some similarities to regulation of these types of speech, defendants' actions are properly characterized as viewpoint-based regulation of private speech. In light of those conclusions, which entitle WD to the injunctive relief it seeks, we need not reach WD's facial First Amendment challenge concerning discretionary prior restraints. Finally, from our First Amendment analysis, it follows that the District Court reached erroneous conclusions regarding WD's equal protection and New York State Constitution claims.
We review de novo ""a district court's ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, in each case construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party."" Novella v. Westchester Cty., 661 F.3d 128, 139 (2d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment may be granted if there is ""no genuine dispute as to any material fact"" and the moving party is ""entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
I. OGS's decisions to deny WD's Lunch Program applications
As set out below, the constitutionality of defendants' actions depends on what OGS was targeting—content or a viewpoint—when it denied WD's Lunch Program applications and whether WD's branding, if WD had been included in the Lunch Program, would have been WD's own private speech or, instead, a form of government speech. The answers to those questions, in turn, set the level of constitutional scrutiny we must apply as we evaluate WD's challenges to defendants' actions.
We conclude that defendants engaged in viewpoint discrimination when they denied WD's applications because WD branded its truck and products with ethnic slurs. We reject defendants' arguments that WD's speech should be seen as government speech. As a result, defendants' actions are subject to, and fail, heightened scrutiny, irrespective of whether we categorize WD's speech as commercial speech, speech in a public forum, or speech in a nonpublic forum. We therefore reverse that portion of the District Court's judgment that concerns the constitutionality of OGS's decisions to deny WD's Lunch Program applications.
A. Viewpoint discrimination
As set out above, WD contends that defendants discriminated against its viewpoint when, because the WD truck and its products were branded with ethnic slurs, they denied WD's Lunch Program application. Defendants agree that they denied WD's application because of its use of what they saw as ethnic slurs. They argue, however, that WD's use of this language did not reflect any real ""viewpoint"": when deposed, defendants observe, Loguidice and Snooks described their use of the language as nothing more than a ""nod to [their] Italian heritage"" and as part of how they presented WD as ""the people's truck."" App. 73, 169. According to defendants, WD's adoption of a coherent message of ""irreverent, blue-collar solidarity"" has been ""manufacture[d] . . . post-hoc."" Appellees' Br. 38. Defendants also contend that they rejected WD's application not because of any message that WD might have intended to convey, but rather because WD's use of ethnic slurs was ""offensive"" and not ""family friendly."" Id. at 39. For the reasons set out below, and in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), we hold that OGS's denials amounted to viewpoint discrimination.
Government ""[d]iscrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional."" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). ""Viewpoint discrimination is a `subset or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content discrimination,' in which `the government targets not subject matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject.'"" Make the Rd. by Walking, Inc. v. Turner, 378 F.3d 133, 150 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted) (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829, 831). The government discriminates against viewpoints when it disfavors certain speech because of ""the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker."" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829.
As we have noted, ""the distinction between content discrimination . . . and viewpoint discrimination . . . is somewhat imprecise."" Make the Rd. by Walking, 378 F.3d at 150; see also Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 831 (""[T]he distinction is not a precise one.""). But the Supreme Court's recent decision in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), provides substantial guidance regarding viewpoint discrimination in the context of speech labeled ""offensive""—in particular, language generally perceived as ethnic slurs. In Matal, the Court addressed the constitutionality of a statutory provision ""prohibit[ing] the registration of a trademark `which may disparage . . . persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.'"" Id. at 1753 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a)). The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO"") applied the statute to reject proposed marks, including that proposed in Matal, if a ""substantial composite . . . of the referenced group would find the proposed mark . . . to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes,"" whether or not the applicant was a member of that group or ""ha[d] good intentions"" in using the term. Id. at 1754. At issue in the case was the PTO's rejection of an application to register the mark ""The Slants,"" the name of a musical band, which the PTO judged to be an ethnic slur offensive or derogatory to Asian-Americans. The band, whose members were Asian-American, contended that their use of the slur helped them ""`reclaim' the term and drain its denigrating force."" Id. at 1751.
Although split between two opinions, all eight Justices participating in Matal concluded that the PTO's rejection of The Slants' mark constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. See id. at 1763 (Justice Alito's lead opinion joined by three other Justices), 1765 (Justice Kennedy's concurrence joined, in relevant part, by three other Justices). Importantly, they reached that conclusion even though the trademark application at issue ""was denied not because the Government thought [the applicant's] object was to demean or offend but because the Government thought his trademark would have that effect on at least some Asian-Americans."" Id. at 1766 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added); see also id. at 1763 (Alito, J.) (""[The statute] denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group."").
Justice Kennedy's concurrence explains further why the PTO's practice was not saved by either its ""appli[cation] in equal measure to any trademark that demeans or offends"" or by the PTO's disregard of ""the applicant's personal views or reasons for using the mark."" Id. at 1766. As to the first point, the concurrence stresses that ""mandating positivity . . . might silence dissent and distort the marketplace of ideas"" even though the mandate is applied evenhandedly to all participants. Id. As to the second point, the concurrence rejects the notion that the government can ""insulate a law from charges of viewpoint discrimination by tying censorship to the [expected] reaction of the speaker's audience,"" rather than to the speaker's views or intentions. Id. at 1766-67. That is because ""a speech burden based on audience reactions is simply government hostility and intervention in a different guise""—""[t]he speech is targeted, after all, based on the government's disapproval of the speaker's choice of message."" Id. at 1767.
Applying Matal to the facts presented here leaves little doubt that defendants' actions in rejecting WD's speech are correctly seen as viewpoint, not merely content, discrimination. Wherever one might draw the line between expressions of ""viewpoint"" and other categories of speech content in a different context, Matal is clear that ""[g]iving offense is a viewpoint"" when it comes to ethnic slurs, id. at 1763 (Alito, J.)—at least when giving ""offense"" to an audience is the sole effect that the government is targeting. See also id. at 1766 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (""[T]he Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive . . . is the essence of viewpoint discrimination."").
In other contexts, however, ethnic slurs might cause negative effects of a different sort—that is, not mere ""offense""—that the government could target without engaging in viewpoint discrimination. A hostile work environment claim under antidiscrimination law is one example. Most antidiscrimination laws ""regulate[] membership and employment policies as conduct, not as expression,"" and ""prohibit[] discriminatory membership and employment policies not because of the viewpoints such policies express, but because of the immediate harms . . . such discrimination causes."" Boy Scouts of Am. v. Wyman, 335 F.3d 80, 93 (2d Cir. 2003). These laws, while perhaps causing ""viewpoint disparity"" in workplaces, are generally not considered viewpoint discriminatory.[4] Id. Nothing in Matal or this opinion changes that.
Nor does Matal call into question the government's ability to regulate speech, including the use of slurs, that constitutes a ""true threat"" of violence, Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 359-60 (2003), ""harassment,"" Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 723-24 (2000), or ""fighting words,"" R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 386 (1992) (observing that fighting words have an ""unprotected . . . nonspeech element"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); NLRB v. Pier Sixty, LLC, 855 F.3d 115, 124 n.46 (2d Cir. 2017) (describing fighting words as ""so insulting in both content and delivery that they are likely to provoke the listener to respond violently""). Defendants here, however, have not argued that WD's speech falls within these unprotected categories.
Ultimately, we think Matal compels the conclusion that defendants have unconstitutionally discriminated against WD's viewpoint by denying its Lunch Program applications because WD branded itself and its products with ethnic slurs. Although ethnic slurs are used to express a variety of opinions and obtain a variety of effects, under Matal the mere use of these potentially offensive words in the factual setting presented here reflects a viewpoint and cannot be framed by the government as a larger viewpoint-neutral category of speech content available to advance multiple viewpoints and therefore subject to less First Amendment protection.
Thus, contrary to defendants' suggestion, we need not delineate the full extent of the message that Loguidice and Snooks were trying to convey. Whatever the intended message, WD's use of ethnic slurs reflects a viewpoint about when and how such language should be used. Further, it matters not that defendants, like the PTO in Matal, might well have targeted ethnic slurs solely because of the audience's expected reaction, rather than because of WD's intended message. Defendants engaged in viewpoint discrimination here even if the denial of WD's application resulted from an across-the-board prohibition applicable to all speakers without regard to their intended messages.
In light of the clarification provided by Matal, therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred in its assessment: the undisputed facts show that defendants did engage in viewpoint discrimination when they denied WD's Lunch Program applications solely because the WD truck and its products were branded with ethnic slurs. Given Matal's clarity on this point, we think it unnecessary to discuss at length earlier precedents that could be interpreted as supporting a different conclusion.[5]
B. Government speech and government contractor speech
Defendants further contend, however, that any viewpoint discrimination on their part is of no moment because OGS's denial of WD's application should be understood as a permissible manifestation of OGS's own government speech—a refusal to endorse ethnic slurs in a state-sponsored program—or as lawful regulation of speech made by a government contractor.[6] We are not persuaded by these arguments.
1. Government speech
""When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it says."" Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2239, 2245 (2015). When it acts as a speaker, the government is entitled to favor certain views over others. See id. at 2251. The question is whether speech by the vendors participating in the Lunch Program—an event involving both the government and private individuals—is properly characterized by defendants as government speech. For the reasons set out below, we find the government speech characterization inapt here.
The Supreme Court has identified forms of speech belonging to the government despite private individuals' involvement. In Walker, the Court held that specialty automobile license plates issued by Texas were government speech over which the government could exercise editorial control. The Court cited three factors underlying its conclusion: (1) ""the history of license plates show[ed] that . . . they long ha[d] communicated messages from the States,"" id. at 2248; (2) ""license plate designs [we]re often closely identified in the public mind with the [State],"" id. (internal quotation marks omitted); and (3) ""Texas maintain[ed] control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates,"" id. at 2249. Applying a similar framework, the Court has also found to be government speech a city's refusal to place a private group's permanent religious monument in the city's park alongside other religious and secular displays. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 481 (2009). Explaining its rationale, it cited the history of government use of monuments to speak to the public; the fact that observers generally expected permanent monuments to convey a message on the property owner's behalf; and the city's control over the selection of monuments. Id. at 470-73.
At the same time, however, speech that is otherwise private does not become speech of the government merely because the government provides a forum for the speech or in some way allows or facilitates it. See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 811-13 (1985) (holding that a charity drive organized by government was nonpublic forum for private speakers to solicit donations, and therefore that viewpoint discrimination was prohibited); Latino Officers Ass'n, N.Y., Inc. v. City of N.Y., 196 F.3d 458, 468-69 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that a police department's refusal to permit police affinity group to march in parades was not a form of government speech). In its recent decision in Matal, the Supreme Court held that trademark registration, and the PTO's refusal to register marks deemed offensive, was not a form of government speech. Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1757-60. The Matal Court unanimously underscored that it exercises ""great caution before extending [its] government-speech precedents,"" citing the risk that ""private speech could be passed off as government speech"" and ""silence[d]"" by ""simply affixing a government seal of approval."" Id. at 1758. It characterized Walker's holding allowing state regulation of license plate content as ""mark[ing] the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine."" Id. at 1760.
Applying the Walker/Summum factors here, we find it hard to accept the proposition that OGS's denial of WD's application was a form of government speech, rather than regulation of private speech. Unlike in both Walker and Summum, defendants have not pointed to any record evidence of a well-established history of OGS's controlling the names of Lunch Program vendors in order to tailor a government message. They concede that the Lunch Program has existed for only ""a few years,"" and the history they cite is a general history of ""sponsor[ing]"" assertedly ""analogous programs"" in the Plaza. Appellees' Br. 58.
Further, to the extent that OGS does have a history of screening applications for various permits to use Empire State Plaza, we see little to distinguish OGS's role from the role filled by any state or local government entity that decides whether to grant permits to use any public lands. The record contains no basis for thinking that Lunch Program vendors' names, any more than the names of other organizations that receive permits to use public lands for special events, are closely identified with the government ""in the public mind."" Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1760. In addition—drawing on the Court's reasoning in Summum, which also involved the use of public land—we find it significant that the food vendors participating in the Lunch Program are a merely temporary feature of the landscape, and quite visibly so. In Summum, by contrast, the Court rested its holding in part on the notion that observers of a monument placed on government property would, partly from its permanence, generally infer that the monument expressed a message endorsed by the government. See 555 U.S. at 470-73.
Having said that, we acknowledge that the Lunch Program is more than simply a grant of access to public lands to which OGS has affixed a government seal and a ""program"" designation. More than simply access to Empire State Plaza, OGS provides additional assistance to vendors by publicizing the program and by providing vendors with access to electricity and water on the Plaza through facilities installed there. We have little trouble rejecting the argument that OGS was expressing its own views when it refused to allow WD physical access to Empire State Plaza—apart from this further assistance—during the Lunch Program. But we think a more difficult question is posed by OGS's declining, because of WD's branding, to provide facilities and promotional support for WD's participation in the Lunch Program. The First Amendment might conceivably bar the former action (preventing physical access) but not the latter (refusing additional support).[7]
The additional assistance provided to permitted vendors by OGS lends support to defendants' assertion that WD's participation would be perceived by the public as government speech, and also implicates another line of argument that is not clearly expressed in their brief: that government may ""set spending priorities"" and ""selectively fund . . . activities it believes to be in the public interest."" Nat'l Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 588 (1998). Arguably, OGS's modest additional assistance was a form of selective funding. This argument, however, raises ""a notoriously tricky question of constitutional law."" Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1760 (Alito, J.). In general, ""if a party objects to a condition on the receipt of [government] funding, its recourse is to decline the funds,"" but sometimes ""a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights."" Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2328 (2013).
Still, even taking account of the possible import of OGS's additional assistance, we conclude that the record in this case cannot support concluding that OGS expressed its own message by denying WD's Lunch Program applications. For all the reasons already reviewed above, we find it implausible that OGS, by permitting WD's full participation in the Lunch Program, would be viewed by the public as having adopted WD's speech as its own. In Matal, the PTO ""d[id] not dream up the[] marks""; it merely registered them, a service provided to many trademark applicants. Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1758. Here, OGS did not ""dream up"" or adopt WD's branding, nor would a reasonable observer think it did so simply because of the incidental assistance that OGS provides to Lunch Program vendors.
We arrive at the same conclusion when the issue is framed in terms of OGS's entitlement to fund private speech selectively. To begin with, we are not so sure that OGS's incidental assistance to vendors constitutes a significant government benefit separate and apart from providing access to the forum itself. As we discuss below, the government's making available a forum for private speech does not constitute a ""subsidy,"" and is circumscribed by a specific set of constitutional restrictions that includes a rule against viewpoint discrimination. It is true that OGS's local publicity efforts and provision of on-site water and electricity sources are not elements of the most basic definition of the ""forum"" at issue here: Empire State Plaza as a physical space. But in creating forums for private activity, the government sometimes furnishes services or tangible goods, not access to a physical space. In Cornelius, for example, the private speech occurred in literature produced by the government to promote a charity drive. See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 791.
As Justice Alito observed in a portion of his Matal opinion joined by three other Justices, the government's provision of a speech-facilitating service (there, trademark registration) in return for a fee—in the case of the Lunch Program, a $1500 fee—hardly resembles a typical government subsidy, see Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1761 (Alito, J.), and perhaps in some instances looks more like creating a forum, see id. at 1763 (suggesting that forum doctrine, rather than precedents about ""government programs,"" might be the proper framework for understanding trademark registration). In addition, treating as government ""subsidies"" not only ""cash subsidies or their equivalent,"" but also ""government service[s] . . . utilized by only some, e.g., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways,"" id. at 1763 (Alito, J.), would empower government to place speech-related conditions on citizens' access to numerous essential public services. Adopting such a capacious view of government's prerogative to fund speech selectively would represent a step far beyond Supreme Court precedent and likely conflict with the fundamental purposes of the First Amendment.
But even were we to accept the theory that OGS ""subsidizes"" Lunch Program vendors' speech beyond merely creating a forum, we do not think that defendants have avoided the First Amendment's prohibition of government viewpoint discrimination. We acknowledge that ""viewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained [as government speech] . . . [w]hen the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message."" Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 541 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). This principle does not apply, however, when a government program is not designed to ""promote a governmental message."" Id. at 542. When a government program's very concept contemplates presenting a diversity of views from participating private speakers, the government may not then ""single out a particular idea for suppression because it [is] dangerous or disfavored."" Id. at 541; see also Nat'l Endowment for the Arts, 524 U.S. at 587 (""[E]ven in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Further, the government ""cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise."" Legal Servs. Corp., 531 U.S. at 547.
The design of the Lunch Program conflicts with the notion that OGS somehow employs the program—and the language used by the vendors—to convey a government message. Defendants stress that OGS aims to make the Lunch Program ""family-friendly,"" and we do not doubt that that is so. But the record does not document OGS's having organized the Lunch Program for the purpose of conveying any message at all. The purpose was to provide casual outdoor lunch options to state employees and visitors to the capital. And the structure of the program—inviting outside vendors to bring their own food trucks—seems to contemplate that, through signs and advertising décor to differentiate one from the other, participating vendors will bring some of their own diverse personal expression—not government messages— to Empire State Plaza. Nor does the record reflect that the vendors accepted into the Lunch Program are selected because of their ability to help convey a coherent government message. Instead, the reasonable inference to be drawn from the record is that the Lunch Program generally accepted all applicants during the relevant time period, and WD's rejection was exceptional: for both the 2013 Lunch Program and the 2014 Lunch Program, every vendor who completed an application was accepted, except for WD. OGS's acceptance of the ""Slidin' Dirty"" truck in the Lunch Program further illustrates the point.
We do not doubt that the government has a legitimate interest in promoting family-friendly messages, speaking directly itself or through selective subsidies. But on the undisputed facts in the record before us, we are unable to conclude that OGS was aiding the transmission of a government message by denying WD's Lunch Program applications.
For these reasons, we conclude that defendants' actions were not OGS's ""government speech."" The government speech doctrine therefore offers defendants no refuge from the First Amendment's prohibition of viewpoint discrimination.
2. Government contractor speech
Defendants also argue that OGS's actions should be seen as conditions placed on a prospective government contractor's speech—that is, WD's speech—and thus are subject to, and satisfy, the balancing of interests described by Board of County Commissioners, Wabaunsee County v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668 (1996) (holding that First Amendment requires fact-intensive and deferential balancing of government's interests against government contractors' speech interests, in line with the standard applied to government employees under Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968)). We reject this argument as well.
Defendants point out that OGS conceived of the Lunch Program as a substitute for the government's prior contract with Sodexo to provide lunch at the Plaza during the summer months, and that the Lunch Program vendor application materials advised that OGS planned to ""subcontract[]"" food service operations to interested vendors. App. 407. But defendants cite no authority for the proposition that these facts alone effectively render WD a prospective government contractor. Neither Pickering nor its progeny, including Umbehr, relied on by defendants, are on point. In those cases, the government agreed to pay public moneys to private individuals for services to be rendered, and therefore had a stronger interest in restricting those individuals' speech than in restricting the speech of the public at large. See Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 675-78; Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.
Our factual setting differs significantly. It is true that the Lunch Program is an economic arrangement involving OGS and private vendors—an arrangement that OGS is not compelled to enter into—and that the vendors stand to generate revenue for themselves as a result of the arrangement. It is also true that OGS indirectly benefits from the goods and services the food vendors provide as part of this exchange: through the program, it provides its employees outdoor lunch options. But that is where the resemblance to government contracting ends. What OGS provides in this exchange is access to a forum—an issue governed by forum doctrine, not Umbehr—and modest nonmonetary assistance that facilitates the use of that forum. And it is those employees and other private citizens, not OGS, that actually pay the food vendors for their goods and services and directly benefit from them. The only monetary exchange between the food vendors and OGS is a fee paid by the vendors to OGS.
In light of those considerations, we see the food vendors not as government contractors, but rather as private entities that pay to access public benefits and, in using those benefits to their economic advantage, secondarily satisfy a government purpose. To categorize WD as a prospective government contractor would represent a considerable and, we think, unwarranted expansion of Umbehr. We therefore reject defendants' argument and decline to analyze WD's speech under a government contractor rubric.
C. Whether defendants' viewpoint discrimination was justified
Defendants have not argued that their actions, if correctly characterized as viewpoint discrimination against WD's private speech, were sufficiently justified by OGS's governmental interests to survive First Amendment scrutiny. Nor do we think that that argument could be successfully made here, but we address it briefly to complete the analytical picture.
In general, government viewpoint discrimination against private speech violates the First Amendment unless it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. Amidon v. Student Ass'n of State Univ. of N.Y. at Albany, 508 F.3d 94, 105-06 (2d Cir. 2007); Husain v. Springer, 494 F.3d 108, 128 n.14 (2d Cir. 2007). This rule applies to private speech delivered on public property regardless of how the property is categorized under forum doctrine. See Make the Rd. by Walking, 378 F.3d at 142-43. It is therefore unnecessary for us to identify the type of forum at issue here before assessing whether OGS's actions were justified: we would apply the same level of scrutiny whether WD sought to speak in a public forum (as WD contends) or a nonpublic forum (as defendants contend).
As to the effect of classifying WD's speech as commercial, the Supreme Court's decision in Matal is again instructive. Joined by three other Justices, Justice Alito refused to recognize the government's ""interest in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend"" as a ""substantial interest"" that could support commercial speech regulation under Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980). Matal, 137 S. Ct. at 1764-65. Similarly, Justice Kennedy concluded in his concurrence in Matal that the statutory provision at issue there was unconstitutional whether or not the speech was ""commercial"" and subject to Central Hudson's relaxed standard. Id. at 1767. He explained that ""the viewpoint based discrimination at issue . . . necessarily invoke[d] heightened scrutiny"" and would ""remain[] of serious concern in the commercial context."" Id. It is possible that this ""heightened scrutiny"" of viewpoint discrimination in the commercial speech context is less exacting than the scrutiny applicable to viewpoint discrimination outside that context. But Matal instructs that viewpoint discrimination is scrutinized closely whether or not it occurs in the commercial speech context.
Reviewing the record and the parties' submissions, we perceive no governmental interest of sufficient weight to justify defendants' actions, regardless of how we might resolve the parties' disagreement over the most appropriate categorization of WD's speech (commercial speech, speech in a public forum, or speech in a nonpublic forum).
* * *
For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment in defendants' favor on the question whether they violated WD's First Amendment rights by denying WD's Lunch Program applications because its truck and products were branded with language commonly seen as ethnic slurs. We further conclude that WD is entitled to summary judgment in its favor on that question. We therefore reverse that portion of the District Court's judgment and remand the case with instructions for the District Court to enter an order declaring that defendants' conduct as to both the 2013 and 2014 applications violated WD's First Amendment rights, and enjoining defendants from denying WD's future Lunch Program applications because of WD's use of ethnic slurs in its branding.[8]
II. Selective-enforcement claim
Our determination under Matal that defendants discriminated against WD's viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment leads us to conclude that the District Court erred also in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to WD's selective-enforcement claim under the Equal Protection Clause. We therefore reverse this portion of the District Court's judgment as well.
To prevail on its selective-enforcement theory, WD must show ""(1) that [it] was treated differently from other similarly situated businesses and (2) that such differential treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person."" Cine SK8, Inc. v. Town of Henrietta, 507 F.3d 778, 790 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). WD argues that, while all other vendors applying to participate in the Lunch Program—including the ""Slidin' Dirty"" truck—were granted permits, WD's application was denied because of the exercise of its constitutional rights in branding itself and its products with ethnic slurs.
We agree with WD that its selective-enforcement claim has merit. Again, defendants do not dispute that they denied WD's Lunch Program applications because of WD's use of ethnic slurs. And although defendants have cited WD's failure to submit a complete application on time as an additional basis for denying the application, it is undisputed that other Lunch Program applications were approved despite being late or incomplete. Defendants point to nothing that distinguishes WD's application from the other applications that they approved—aside from their judgment, in violation of the First Amendment, that WD's branding was too offensive to be permitted. This demonstrates that defendants' ""differential treatment was based on . . . intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights."" Id.
In light of these undisputed facts, the District Court should have granted summary judgment in WD's favor. We therefore reverse the District Court's judgment as to WD's selective-enforcement claim and instruct the District Court, on remand, to include in its order of relief a declaration that defendants violated WD's equal protection rights.
III. Claims under the New York State Constitution
The New York State Constitution's free speech and equal protection provisions are at least as protective as their federal counterparts. ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., 720 F.3d 490, 498 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Immuno AG. v. Moor-Jankowski, 567 N.E.2d 1270, 1278 (N.Y. 1991)) (free speech); Brown v. State, 674 N.E.2d 1129, 1140 (N.Y. 1996) (equal protection). We therefore also reverse the District Court's judgment as to WD's claims under the New York State Constitution and instruct the District Court to include a declaration of WD's rights to free speech and equal protection under the New York State Constitution in the order of relief.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court should have granted summary judgment in WD's favor and should not have granted summary judgment for defendants. Under Matal, defendants discriminated against WD's viewpoint and therefore ran afoul of the First Amendment, whether WD's speech is categorized as commercial speech, speech in a public forum, or speech in a nonpublic forum. Defendants' actions are not rendered permissible by doctrines applicable to government speech and government contractor speech. Although bearing some similarities to government speech and the regulation of government contractor speech, defendants' actions are properly characterized as viewpoint-based regulation of private speech. It follows from all of the above that the District Court also reached erroneous conclusions regarding WD's equal protection and New York State Constitution claims.
Accordingly, the District Court's judgment is REVERSED, and the cause is REMANDED with instructions to the District Court to enter an order that: (1) declares that defendants' conduct violated WD's First Amendment rights and enjoins defendants from denying WD's future Lunch Program applications solely because of WD's use of ethnic slurs in its branding; (2) declares that defendants violated WD's equal protection rights; and (3) declares that defendants violated WD's rights to free speech and equal protection under the New York State Constitution.
[*]   Judge Carol Bagley Amon, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.
[1]  We refer to ""defendants,"" but note that not all of the original defendants are party to this appeal. The John Does named in the complaint remain unidentified. WD's claims against the New York State Office of General Services and the State of New York were dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds; that dismissal is not challenged on appeal. Finally, WD filed a stipulation of dismissal of its claims against the New York Racing Association, Inc., Christopher K. Kay, and Stephen Travers.
[2]  Except where indicated, the facts described here are undisputed. They are drawn primarily from the statements of material facts submitted by the parties in conjunction with their cross-motions for summary judgment in accordance with Rule 7.1(a)(3) of the Local Rules of Practice of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
[3]  Defendants have not expressly admitted that an application for a food truck named ""Slidin' Dirty"" was accepted, but they have not challenged WD's factual assertion that one was.
[4]  Antidiscrimination laws can, of course, raise First Amendment concerns of a different sort, relating to associational rights. See, e.g., Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000); Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537 (1987).
[5]  In Perry v. McDonald, for example, we concluded that a state did not engage in unlawful viewpoint discrimination when it rejected a request for a ""SHTHPNS"" vanity plate, while at the same time allowing plates such as ""COWPIES,"" ""POOPER,"" and ""BM."" 280 F.3d 159, 170-71 (2d Cir. 2001). Although all the language on the plates was scatological, ""SHTHPNS"" was the only ""offensive"" plate because it contained ""easily recognizable profanities."" Id. We held that the government was not targeting the worldview underlying the phrase ""shit happens,"" but rather the use of profanities to express that philosophy, and that the latter objective did not amount to viewpoint discrimination. Of course, following the Supreme Court's decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., the state's rejection of the vanity plate might now be permitted on the alternative ground that the plate's language constituted government speech. 135 S. Ct. 2239, 2246 (2015) (""[S]pecialty license plates issued pursuant to Texas's statutory scheme convey government speech."").
[6]  We note that the District Court raised and addressed these issues sua sponte without affording WD an opportunity to be heard on them. These issues, however, are legal in nature and, on appeal, have been fully briefed by both parties. In the interest of judicial economy, we therefore reach them now.
[7]  Of course, within the bounds of the First Amendment, OGS may place content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, and manner of speech delivered on government property. But defendants have not argued that their denial of WD's application was motivated by legitimate concerns about the time, place, or manner of WD's speech (e.g., crowding). Rather, their denial was motivated by the speech's viewpoint.
[8]  In light of this disposition, we need not reach WD's argument that OGS's process for reviewing Lunch Program applications involved a facially unconstitutional exercise of discretion. See Amidon, 508 F.3d at 103 (discussing the ""constitutional proscription against granting unbridled discretion in the prior restraint context""). WD's facial challenge focuses on OGS's decisions to reject otherwise eligible Lunch Program applicants who were, in OGS's estimation, insufficiently ""family-friendly."" In terms of relief, WD requests neither monetary damages, nor an injunction terminating the entire Lunch Program; WD seeks merely to have its application ""considered on the same basis as all other applicants[`] and not on the basis of its speech."" Appellant's Reply Br. 22. We have already concluded that, on the facts of this case, the First Amendment prohibits OGS from denying applicants a permit solely because their branding contains language that some might find objectionable. WD does not identify any other impermissibly discretionary facets of OGS's process for reviewing Lunch Program applicants. We therefore see no need to assess WD's theory of facial unconstitutionality.
